## ⚠️ MVP STATUS AND DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: pgflow is currently a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in very early stages of development. When working on this codebase:

- **PRIORITIZE CUTTING SCOPE**: Focus on core functionality only - be ruthless about dropping nice-to-have features
- **SIMPLIFY AGGRESSIVELY**: Choose the simplest implementation that works, not the most elegant or complete
- **FOLLOW THE PARETO PRINCIPLE**: Aim for 80% of value with 20% of effort - perfect solutions are the enemy of shipped solutions
- **TIME IS CRITICAL**: Make time-saving tradeoffs even at the expense of minor technical debt
- **AVOID PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION**: Get it working first, optimize later only if absolutely necessary
- **LIMIT ABSTRACTIONS**: Introduce new patterns/abstractions only when absolutely needed

When suggesting changes or improvements, bias heavily toward solutions that can be implemented quickly with minimal complexity.
