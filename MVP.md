# MVP

## Problem

### Problem Statement

_**What is the problem the MVP is trying to solve?**_

I am a data/knowledge hoarder and i save a lot of stuff for later but i rarely use the knowledge so me adding metadata does not even help with using the info later.

### Solution

_**How does the MVP aim to solve this problem?**_

PART 1 - metadata

I want AI to add metadata and categorize/index/cluster the incoming raw, without metdata input text that comes from various sources:

- just an input if you want to memorize something, save for later, have an idea worth keeping, figure out something, want to do something later, something happens later and you cannto forgot, some things are need to be done etc
- various integrations like github, gmail, slack etc - any source of public activity that we do can be ingested and made searchable

PART 2 - context aware copilot that suggests/pushes right content at the right time and context, unobtrusively, so you do not need to "poll" for the stuff

### Expected Outcome

_**What is the expected outcome or benefit of the MVP?**_

I want following sources to be searchable and indexed:

- random input
- github and gitlab stars, commits, PRs

## `/` - main page

A feed-like or chat-like interface with an input on the bottom

alternatively:
a centered input that emphasizes that its about saving/dumping stuff, not about reading (at least on this view)

## `/search` - search page
