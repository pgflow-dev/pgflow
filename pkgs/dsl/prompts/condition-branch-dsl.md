# Exploring Conditional Branching Strategies in a Flow DSL for Autonomous LLM Agents

## Overview

In many workflow or pipeline systems, you encounter the need to conditionally run certain tasks (or *steps*) depending on some portion of the state, such as:
- Prior steps’ outputs
- User input
- External signals (like database queries, APIs, Large Language Model responses, etc.)

Traditionally, **conditional steps** can achieve this by saying “if condition is met, run this step; otherwise, skip this step (and skip all of its dependents).” However, you might also design a DSL with a more explicit **branching model**, splitting your flow definition into *runIf* and *runUnless* callbacks (or even `if / else` blocks).

This document brainstorms two approaches:
1. **Skip-based conditional steps**: Each step has an attached condition. If the condition fails, that step is skipped along with all its transitive dependents in the DAG.
2. **Branch-based DSL**: Define “branches” (like callbacks or subflows) that only execute if certain conditions are met. For example, use `.runIf(...)` or `.runUnless(...)` and pass a closure describing the branch’s steps.

We’ll explore:
- Conceptual differences, benefits, and drawbacks
- How each interacts with the rest of the flow (DAG)
- An extended example from a business logic perspective, imagining an *agentic system* that makes decisions based on LLM outputs.

We will not dive into implementation details, but instead focus on how each approach might impact **usability**, **developer experience**, **readability**, and **expressiveness**.

## 1. Skip-Based Conditional Steps

### 1.1 How It Works

- You define each step with a condition, e.g. `{ runIf: { run: { value: 23 }, fetch: { status: "success" } } }`.  
- When the flow engine is about to run the step, it checks the condition against the step’s input.  
- If the condition fails:
  - The step is marked as *skipped*.  
  - All downstream dependents are also marked as *skipped* (since they depend on a step that never “completed”).  

### 1.2 Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Each step knows whether it should run or not. The condition is essentially a property of the step itself.  
- **Fine-grained control**: You can easily say “Step X only runs if Step Y’s output matches condition Z.”  
- **Familiar DAG structure**: The “skip” logic is layered on top of the same DAG logic—there’s no separate branching construct.  

### 1.3 Disadvantages

- **Complex to visualize**: When steps have multiple dependents, a single skip can cause multiple branches to get skipped in a non-obvious way.  
- **Potential code clutter**: If you have many conditional variations, you might see many `runIf` or `runUnless` conditions scattered throughout the steps in a less structured manner.  
- **Less explicit branching**: Branches are “emergent” from skip-based logic, rather than explicitly grouped in code.  

### 1.4 Use Cases That Shine

- You want minimal overhead, and your flow’s branching conditions are fairly small.  
- It’s acceptable that steps simply skip if upstream conditions are not met, rather than a visually distinct set of branches.  

---

## 2. Branch-Based DSL

### 2.1 How It Works

Instead of attaching a condition directly to a single step, the DSL introduces constructs such as:

```ts
.runIf(
  { run: { value: 23 }, fetch: { status: "success" } },
  (branch) => {
    branch.step(...) 
          .step(...)
          .step(...);
  }
)
```

And similarly, `.runUnless(...)`, or even a more explicit `if/else` style:

```ts
.if(condition, (branch) => {
  branch.then(...)
        .then(...);
})
.else((branch) => {
  branch.then(...)
        .then(...);
});
```

The callback function for each branch is executed when the DSL is being built, allowing you to define subflows or sub-branches. Conceptually, this is akin to building multiple smaller subflows that attach back to the main DAG.

### 2.2 Advantages

1. **Clear, visual branch structure**: Reading the code is like reading normal branching logic. Each branch stands on its own in the code.  
2. **Group separation**: Branch steps live in a dedicated “branch block” – helps the developer see the grouping and reason about them together.  
3. **Scalable to subflows**: This style can more easily be extended to encapsulate subflows. For instance, you might have a `Flow` that you can reuse as a “callable” subflow inside a `runIf(...)` block.  

### 2.3 Disadvantages

1. **Complex flow creation**: More methods literally branching the code might feel more complicated if your use case only needs a few simple conditions.  
2. **Harder to see the global DAG**: The flow might be expressed across multiple nested callbacks, which can spread the code around. If you prefer a single “flat” DAG listing, that might get lost.  
3. **Overhead for simple cases**: If your condition is minimal, the overhead of creating a branching block might outweigh the clarity.

## 3. Comparing Ease of Use, Developer Experience, & Readability

### 3.1 Ease of Use

- **Skip-based**: Easiest if you’re used to a single DAG. Simple to declare a condition on each step.  
- **Branch-based**: Potentially more intuitive for developers who want explicit “branch blocks” resembling typical programming `if` statements.  

### 3.2 Developer Experience

- **Skip-based**:  
  - Quick to add or adjust a single step’s condition without touching code structure.  
  - But with many conditions, you might lose track of deeper relationships.  

- **Branch-based**:  
  - More natural to read from top to bottom for complex branching.  
  - Nesting can get unwieldy for large flows, but it can also chunk the flow into smaller logical sections.  

### 3.3 Readability & Expressiveness

- **Skip-based**:  
  - A single DAG with various steps. You read the steps topologically, but each step’s condition is somewhat decoupled from other conditions.  
  - Good for small or moderate complexity.  

- **Branch-based**:  
  - Excellent at making your “decision points” explicit.  
  - Feels more like typical imperative code with if/else structures, which can be easier to read for some developers.

## 4. Potential for an Autonomous, Agentic LLM System

Imagine a system that *interacts with a Large Language Model (LLM)* to reason about calls, gather data, or respond to user input. Some potential flows:

1. **Gather user query**  
2. **Call LLM to parse intent**  
3. **Decision**:  
   - If the LLM suggests the user wants a *financial forecast*, proceed with certain steps.  
   - If the LLM suggests the user wants a *sentiment analysis*, proceed with a different route.  
4. … additional data collection, summarization steps, etc.  

### 4.1 Original Idea: Conditional Steps + Skips

We might do something like:

- `step("parseIntent")` → calls an LLM to parse user intent from the query.  
- `step("financialLogic", { runIf: { parseIntent: { classification: "financialForecast" } } })`  
- `step("sentimentLogic", { runIf: { parseIntent: { classification: "sentimentAnalysis" } } })`  

In this setup, if `parseIntent.classification != "financialForecast"`, the `financialLogic` step (and any downstream steps) are skipped. On the flip side, `sentimentLogic` only runs if the classification is “sentimentAnalysis,” otherwise it’s all skipped.

**Pros**:  
- Very direct: attach conditions to steps.  
- We see a single-liner controlling each step’s condition.

**Cons**:  
- If you have multiple conditions branching in multiple different ways, each step’s skip condition can get messy.

### 4.2 New Approach: Branching Blocks

Instead, you could do:

```plaintext
flow.step("parseIntent", ...)

flow.runIf(
  { parseIntent: { classification: "financialForecast" } },
  (branch) => {
    branch.step("forecastData", ...)
    branch.step("generateFinancialReport", ...)
      ...
  }
)

flow.runIf(
  { parseIntent: { classification: "sentimentAnalysis" } },
  (branch) => {
    branch.step("fetchSentimentData", ...)
    branch.step("summarizeSentiment", ...)
      ...
  }
)
```

**Pros**:  
- Clear grouping: The blocks for “financial forecast branch” and “sentiment analysis branch” are each self-contained.  
- Potentially simpler to see the *big picture* and how one branch is entirely distinct from another.

**Cons**:  
- Code can become nested in multiple `.runIf(...)` or `.runUnless(...)` statements.  
- Harder to see a single “flat” DAG—some prefer that approach for clarity.

## 5. Example: An Agentic System with Business Logic

Let’s illustrate two versions of a simple *autonomous agent flow* that decides how to handle user requests. We’ll keep the “handlers” as no-ops, focusing on flow structure.

### 5.1 Scenario

**Business Context**: Suppose we have an agent that:  
1. Receives user query.  
2. Classifies the request using an LLM.  
3. If the user is requesting a “knowledge search”, it fetches from a knowledge base.  
4. If the user wants content generation, it calls the LLM again to generate text.  
5. If at any point an essential step fails or the classification is unknown, the system logs a fallback.

---

### 5.2 Version A: Original Skip-Based Approach

1. **Steps**:  
   - **classifyIntent**: calls the LLM to classify user’s query.  
   - **knowledgeFetch**: skip unless `classifyIntent.output.class == "knowledgeSearch"`.  
   - **contentGen**: skip unless `classifyIntent.output.class == "contentGen"`.  
   - **fallback**: skip unless `classifyIntent.output.class == "unknown"`.  

2. **Flow Outline** (schema-like pseudocode):
   ```
   1) step("classifyIntent", noOpHandler);

   2) step("knowledgeFetch", noOpHandler, {
        runIf: { classifyIntent: { class: "knowledgeSearch" } }
      });

   3) step("contentGen", noOpHandler, {
        runIf: { classifyIntent: { class: "contentGen" } }
      });

   4) step("fallback", noOpHandler, {
        runIf: { classifyIntent: { class: "unknown" } }
      });
   ```

3. **Result**:  
   - The engine checks the `classifyIntent` result.  
   - If it sees `"knowledgeSearch"`, then `knowledgeFetch` runs, while `contentGen` and `fallback` skip.  
   - If it sees `"contentGen"`, then `contentGen` runs, while `knowledgeFetch` and `fallback` skip.  
   - If none match, `fallback` runs.  

**Observations**:  
- Very direct: each step defines a condition.  
- Potentially a bit scattered if the real system grows.

---

### 5.3 Version B: Branch-Based DSL

In a DSL with `.runIf(...)` or `.if(...)`/`.else(...)` style, you might see something like:

```
step("classifyIntent");

runIf({ classifyIntent: { class: "knowledgeSearch" } }, (branch) => {
  branch.step("knowledgeFetch", noOp);
});

runIf({ classifyIntent: { class: "contentGen" } }, (branch) => {
  branch.step("contentGen", noOp);
});

runIf({ classifyIntent: { class: "unknown" } }, (branch) => {
  branch.step("fallback", noOp);
});
```

or an extended *if/else chain* if that’s supported:

```
if({ classifyIntent: { class: "knowledgeSearch" } }, (branch) => {
  branch.step("knowledgeFetch", noOp);
})
.elseIf({ classifyIntent: { class: "contentGen" } }, (branch) => {
  branch.step("contentGen", noOp);
})
.else((branch) => {
  branch.step("fallback", noOp);
});
```

**Observations**:  
- The branching structure is explicit. Readers see the flow as a list of branches off the result of `classifyIntent`.  
- For large or complex logic, you’ll have multiple nested callbacks, which can be very readable if carefully done or more complicated if done haphazardly.

---

## 6. Takeaways: Potential Future

You mentioned a potential advantage that this approach could “be a precedent for creating subflows.” Indeed, the branching style DSL is conducive to that. You could imagine:

```
runIf(condition, (branch) => {
  // Instead of inline steps, you call a "SubFlow"
  // that is itself a smaller DAG with multiple steps
  branch.callFlow(MySubFlow)
});
```

That subflow might be created with the same DSL but is effectively *composed* into the main flow.

### 6.1 Enhanced Reusability

- If you find you repeat certain branching logic, you can wrap it in a subflow call.  
- Smoother packaging of complex tasks (like “content generation flow” or “sentiment flow”).  

### 6.2 Elevated Complexity

- The more you nest subflows or branch logic, the more conceptual overhead for developers.  
- Documentation is key, so that everyone understands where the flow splits or merges.

## 7. Summary of Advantages vs Disadvantages

| **Strategy**          | **Advantages**                                                           | **Disadvantages**                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Skip-Based**        | - Minimal overhead<br>- Straightforward for small condition sets         | - Branch logic can become “hidden”<br>- Not as visually explicit           |
| **Branch-Based DSL**  | - Clear, code-like branching structures<br>- Subflows become natural     | - Potential for deeply nested blocks<br>- Less “flat” DAG overview         |

**What gets easier with Branching**:
- Grouping related steps in a separate portion of the code.  
- Reading the flow as a “story,” from top to bottom.  
- Building hierarchical subflows.

**What gets harder**:
- Merging data from separate branches if needed (you might have to do that carefully).  
- Maintaining a single big DAG picture can be trickier with nested callbacks.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Whether you choose skip-based conditions or a branching DSL depends heavily on:
- **Complexity of your branching**: If minimal, skip-based might be simpler. If you have *heavily nested logic* or want a more code-like “if/else,” branching DSL can be more readable.  
- **Team preferences**: Some prefer explicit branching blocks; others find skip-based step conditions more intuitive.  
- **Future subflows**: If you anticipate lots of composable subflows in your agentic system, the branching DSL might be a more natural building block.  

**Final thoughts**:
- Both patterns can coexist (and they sometimes do).  
- For an *autonomous agentic system* reliant on LLM outputs for major decision points, an explicit branching DSL can provide clarity in code, especially if the LLM’s classification leads to *entirely different sub-pipelines*.  
- For simpler conditionals, skip-based steps are very concise.

This document doesn’t propose a single “best” approach but aims to equip you with a deeper understanding of **trade-offs** so you can choose a style that resonates with your project requirements and developer sensibilities.
