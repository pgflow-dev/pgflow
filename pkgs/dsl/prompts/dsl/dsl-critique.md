# Critique of Current Flow DSL Implementation

Below are several key points where the current Flow DSL could be improved or clarified. These focus on non-trivial issues that aren’t already covered by TypeScript’s type system or foreign key constraints enforcing topological ordering.

## 1. Step Name Collisions
Currently, when adding steps using the `step()` method, there is no mechanism for detecting or preventing duplicate step slugs within the same Flow instance. Accidentally reusing an existing slug would silently overwrite the corresponding `stepDefinitions` entry, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Possible Improvements
- Throw an error if a step is defined more than once with the same slug.
- Provide a helper or check to ensure slugs remain unique in a given Flow.

## 2. Cross-Flow Step References
There is no hard check to ensure that a `dependsOn` array only references steps within the same Flow. If a user mistakenly references a slug that belongs to a different Flow or that doesn’t exist in the current Flow, they’d only discover the error at execution time (e.g., missing output in a payload).

### Possible Improvements
- Validate each `dependsOn` slug to ensure it exists in the current `stepDefinitions`.
- Fail early (i.e., throw) at call time when an invalid dependency is specified.

## 3. Missing Flow-Level Default Fallback
Although each step can define overrides for `maxAttempts`, `baseDelay`, and `timeout`, there is no fallback logic at runtime if a step-level option is undefined. For instance, if a user sets a `baseDelay` at the flow level only, a step requiring that delay but not providing its own override should inherit the flow’s value rather than defaulting to `undefined`.

### Possible Improvements
- When building `stepOptionsStore`, merge step-level overrides with flow-level defaults.
- Expose a utility method (e.g., `getEffectiveOptions(stepSlug)`) that returns the merged set of options for each step.

## 4. Runtime Validation of Handler Output Shape
Since handlers return arbitrary JSON, there is little reassurance at runtime if a handler’s actual returned shape mismatches the inferred type. The TypeScript compiler can help, but cases of dynamic data or incorrectly typed library calls could pass the compiler but break at runtime.

### Possible Improvements
- Provide an optional debug or development mode that checks a handler’s returned data against the inferred type structure (e.g., via JSON schema or similar approach).

## 5. Handling of Late-Added Steps
The current structure re-creates a new `Flow` each time `.step()` is called. If a user tries to add new steps after certain operations or references have been made (such as storing an existing Flow instance for execution), it may cause confusion or partial definitions. The final shape of the Flow is only fully determined after all `.step()` calls, but nothing prevents referencing incomplete or out-of-order definitions in the meantime.

### Possible Improvements
- Enforce a “building phase” vs. “execution phase” distinction—only allow `.step()` declarations before you attempt to retrieve or execute the Flow definitions.
- Consider a final “freeze” step to lock the DSL so no further definitions can be added.

By addressing these points, the Flow DSL will be more robust, more fault-tolerant, and less prone to subtle errors that can arise in real-world usage.
