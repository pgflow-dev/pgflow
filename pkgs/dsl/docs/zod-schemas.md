Below is some guidance on the tradeoffs of leaving schemas out and relying strictly on TypeScript’s type system vs. integrating something like Zod or a similar library for runtime checks, JSON Schema generation, and typed inference.

---

## 1. How “Bad” Was the Decision to Skip Zod Schemas?

In short: it’s not “bad” — it’s a tradeoff. Many TypeScript-based systems don’t use explicit runtime schema validation and still operate just fine in production. By only using TypeScript’s types:

- You already have a clean developer experience, where everything “just works” type-wise.
- You’ve reduced friction in your DSL because the user only has to specify a single type parameter (their “run” input), and everything else is inferred.

**However**, if you need:
1. **Serious runtime safety** (i.e., guaranteeing that inbound JSON matches your types in a real production environment),
2. **Postgres-based validations** (like pg_jsonschema or SQL constraints),
3. **Schema extractions** for external usage (integrations, documentation, or codegen),

then you’ll have more work to do if you rely only on the TypeScript type checker. Pure TypeScript type definitions aren’t enforced at runtime without an additional step or library. That might leave you with an extra build step if you later want to guarantee the data shape at runtime.

---

## 2. Is the System “Closed Off” to Adding Zod Later?

Fortunately, the design of your DSL is quite flexible. If, in the future, you want to add optional `inputSchema` / `outputSchema` properties (which could be Zod schemas) to each step or to the entire Flow, you can usually do that without much disruption. You’d do something like:

```ts
new Flow({
  slug: "my_flow",
  inputSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  // potentially outputSchema if flows themselves yield final output
})
  .step(
    {
      slug: "my_step",
      inputSchema: z.object({ ... }),
      outputSchema: z.object({ ... })
    },
    handlerFn
  )
```

- **Optional**: If the user passes no schema, you keep doing what you do now (TypeScript-only).
- **If they do pass a schema**: 
  - At runtime, you validate the input or output against that schema. 
  - You can also convert the Zod schema to JSON Schema for any Postgres-based validation or generation steps.

This approach can be added without fundamentally altering your existing type system. You’d essentially treat your existing type definitions as “the default,” but if a user wants extra runtime safety (Zod) you let them attach a schema. Your DSL can keep the type inference for the input and output in tandem with Zod. One straightforward pattern is:

1. If a user provides a Zod schema, infer the TypeScript type from Zod (using `z.infer<typeof inputSchema>`).
2. If they don’t provide a Zod schema, default to the type param they gave your DSL.

## 3. Two-Step Deploy vs. Single-Step

When you say you’d need a “two-step deploy”—one to generate JSON Schemas and the other to generate your DAG SQL—here’s how that might play out:

- **Without Zod**: You’d write a separate script or type extractor to parse your TypeScript code into schema definitions. This can be done with e.g. ts-json-schema-generator, but it’s an extra step that might be brittle if your code changes frequently or if you heavily lean on generics and advanced TS features.
- **With Zod**: You’d do it all in one pass from your code, because Zod supports `.toJSON()` or similar to output JSON schemas. This typically requires far less “custom reflection” code.

So, yes, a single-step build is easier if your flows are authored with Zod from the start. But you could also adopt Zod gradually (for new flows or new steps) and keep your older flows with purely TypeScript-defined types. They can coexist.

---

## 4. Can You Keep Inference If You Add Zod?

Yes, you can. Zod can infer TypeScript types from schemas automatically:

```ts
const MySchema = z.object({
  foo: z.string(),
  bar: z.number(),
});
type MyInput = z.infer<typeof MySchema>;
```

Then, your DSL can use those types for the handler signature. Or you can do the reverse: define your handler in TS, then define a matching Zod schema if you want runtime validation. The main difference is that Zod is the “source of truth” for your shape, while your TS code is automatically derived from that shape.

In practice, you can keep your nice `.step()` logic with type inference, and only specify the optional `z.object({})` in the constructor. That should preserve your inference-based approach (no forcing user to specify everything twice) while enabling runtime checks if they want it. For example:

```ts
.step(
  {
    slug: "my_step",
    dependsOn: ["something"],
    inputSchema: StepInputSchema, // Zod
  },
  (payload /* typed from StepInputSchema */) => {
    // ...
  }
);
```

Zod will let you specify the schema once; your DSL can infer `typeof StepInputSchema` for the payload. That can look almost identical from a user’s perspective to how your current DSL looks.

---

## 5. Practical Path Forward

1. **Optionally** allow a user to supply a Zod schema for the Flow input or for each step.  
   - If they provide one, you do runtime validation.  
   - If not, you just skip that portion and rely on normal TypeScript-only checks.
2. **If you need to store the schema in the DB** for Postgres-based checks, you can export the Zod schema to JSON Schema in the same code path that you generate your DAG structure to SQL.
3. **Retain your infer-based DSL** for a good developer experience.  
   - If `inputSchema` is present, you can do `(payload: z.infer<typeof inputSchema>) => ...` automatically, so the user doesn’t double-declare types.  
   - If it’s missing, you do `(payload: StepInput<RunPayload, Steps, Deps>) => ...` the way you do now.

This change can be done incrementally. Existing flows don’t break; new flows can adopt Zod if they want. 

---

## 6. Summary

- **Your current approach isn’t necessarily “bad.”** Many teams rely on TypeScript’s type system alone.
- **Runtime validation** and external schema generation are just more complicated without a library like Zod. You’ll need extra steps (like ts-json-schema-generator or a custom script) to produce JSON Schemas, or else risk not validating at runtime.
- **You can retrofit Zod** later without much friction:  
  - Provide optional `inputSchema` / `outputSchema` fields on flow and steps.  
  - Let the user pass them if they want runtime checks or JSON Schema outputs.  
  - Keep the rest of your type inference logic intact for developer ergonomics.
- **Type inference can remain** mostly the same. Zod can feed (or be inferred by) TypeScript types.  
- **You don’t have to convert everything** at once. You can keep your primarily type-based approach and only adopt Zod for new flows or steps that require runtime validation.

You’re not locked in. If you do want to move to Zod for runtime checks, it’ll likely be a fairly smooth transition to add that as an optional feature in your DSL, rather than a total rewrite.
