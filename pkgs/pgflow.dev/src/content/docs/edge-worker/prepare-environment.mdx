<Aside type="danger" title="Not production ready!">
**Edge Worker** is in alpha stage and it is not production ready yet,
but we will get there!
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
Make sure you have the Supabase CLI installed and local project set up.
If not, see Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. ### Install migration

    Run this command to download the migration file to your project.
    Replace `<supabase-dir>` with your project's `supabase/` directory path.

    ```bash
    wget -O <supabase-dir>/migrations/ https://pgflow.dev/edge-worker.sql
    ```

    Then apply the migration:

    ```bash
    npx supabase migration up
    ```

1. ### Prepare connection string

    Your worke needs to connect to your Supabase project's database.

    Worker is a long lived process, so we should use Supavisor **Session Mode** connection
    (see more in [Connect to your database](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#more-about-connection-pooling) docs).

    In local development use the following connection string:

    ```env
    DB_POOL_URL="postgresql://postgres.pooler-dev:postgres@pooler:6543/postgres"
    ```

    ##### Put this `.env` file here:

    <FileTree>

    - supabase/
        - config.toml
        - package.json
        - functions/
          - my-new-worker/
            - **.env** \<== add the .env file here
            - index.ts

    </FileTree>

1. ### Setup Connection Pool

    You need to change the `db.pooler` section in your `supabase/config.toml` file
    to switch to Supavisor **Session Mode** connection pooling.

    ```diff lang="toml"
      [db.pooler]
      enabled = false
      # Port to use for the local connection pooler.
      port = 54329
      # Specifies when a server connection can be reused by other clients.
      # Configure one of the supported pooler modes: `transaction`, `session`.
    - pool_mode = "transaction"
    + pool_mode = "session"
      # How many server connections to allow per user/database pair.
      default_pool_size = 20
      default_pool_size = 100
      # Maximum number of client connections allowed.
      max_client_conn = 100
    ```

1. ### Setup Edge Runtime policy

    We need to switch Edge Runtime policy to `per_worker` to enable
    Background Tasks (see more in [Testing background tasks locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/background-tasks#testing-background-tasks-locally)).

   ```diff lang="toml"
     [edge_runtime]
     enabled = true
     # Configure one of the supported request policies: `oneshot`, `per_worker`.
     # Use `oneshot` for hot reload, or `per_worker` for load testing.
   - policy = "oneshot"
   + policy = "per_worker"
     # Port to attach the Chrome inspector for debugging edge functions.
     inspector_port = 8083
   ```

1. ### Restart Supabase

    To apply the changes, restart Supabase:

    ```bash
    npx supabase stop
    npx supabase start
    ```

</Steps>

This is it! You are ready to create your first worker and do some processing 🥳
