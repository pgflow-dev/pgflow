**Edge Worker** is a task queue worker that gets messages from a queue and calls user functions with their payload.

Under the hood, it wraps [Supabase Background Tasks](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/background-tasks) and adds a lot of useful features:

- retries with delays
- monitoring and heartbeats
- concurrency control
- horizontal scaling (by deploying multiple edge functions for the same queue)

It treats Edge Function termination due to CPU/clock limits
as an expected occurrence and includes extra measures to handle it as part of
normal operations:

- stops polling as soon as the soft limit is reached
- makes extra effort to gracefully abort pending tasks with abort signals
- uses PGMQ's visibility timeout to ensure **no message is ever lost**
- **spawns new instances** automatically for **continuous operations**
- pings the database with **heartbeats** to ensure the worker's health
