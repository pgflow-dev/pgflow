You can pass optional configuration object as second argument to `EdgeWorker.start()`
to tweak the worker's behavior.

<Aside title="Zero configuration needed" type="tip">
All configuration options are optional and have sane defaults.
</Aside>

### Default configuration

```typescript
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  // how much jobs are processed at the same time
  maxConcurrent: 20,

  // how many connections to the databasee are opened
  maxPgConnections: 4,

  // in-worker polling interval
  maxPollSeconds: 5,

  // in-database polling interval
  pollIntervalMs: 200,

  // how long to wait before retrying a failed job
  retryDelay: 5,

  // how many times to retry a failed job
  retryLimit: 0,

  // how long a job is invisible after reading
  // if not successful, will reappear after this time
  visibilityTimeout: 3,
});
```

## Queue and polling

### `queueName`
**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `'tasks'`

The name of the PGMQ queue to listen to for messages.

<Aside title="You don't need to create queues manually" type="tip">
The worker will automatically create a logged, non-partitioned queue
with configured name during startup if it does not exist.
</Aside>

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  queueName: 'my-custom-queue'
});
```

### `maxPollSeconds`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `5`

Amount of seconds to wait for a message to be available in the queue.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  maxPollSeconds: 5 // Long-poll for 5 seconds waiting for a message
});
```

### `pollIntervalMs`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `200`

The interval for in-database polling that `pgmq.read_with_poll` does.
Most of the time, you don't need to change this value.

<Aside type="caution">
  This value should be lower than the `maxPollSeconds` value.
</Aside>


```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  pollIntervalMs: 300 // Poll every 300ms
});
```

## Retries

### `retryDelay`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `5`

Amount of seconds to wait between retry attempts.

<Aside type="caution">
  This value should be greater than the visibility timeout.
</Aside>

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retryDelay: 5 // Wait 5 seconds between retries
});
```


### `retryLimit`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `0`

Maximum number of retry attempts for failed message processing before marking the message as dead.

<Aside title="No retries by default!" type="danger">
By default messages will not be retried, you need to set this option explicitly.
</Aside>

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retryLimit: 5
});
```

### `visibilityTimeout`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `30`

The duration in seconds that a message is hidden from other consumers while being processed.

<Aside title="Timeouts" type="caution">
Make sure to set it bigger than max time your task can take to complete, otherwise
it will be processed multiple times.
</Aside>

<Aside title="Work-in-Progress" type="danger">
This option is probably subject to be refactored to `timeoutMs` that will
affect timeout for the tasks (wip) and visibility timeout.
**Do not rely on this option heavily for now!**
</Aside>

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  visibilityTimeout: 5 // mesassage will re-appear on queue after 5 seconds if not processed
});
```

## Concurrency

### `maxConcurrent`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `10`

This option limits concurrency - the maximum number of messages that can be processed at the same time.
Increase for IO-heavy tasks (network or db calls), decrease for CPU-heavy tasks.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  batchSize: 10 // Process up to 10 messages at once
});
```

### `maxPgConnections`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `4`

This option limits the number of connections to the database.
Increase for IO-heavy tasks (network or db calls), decrease for CPU-heavy tasks.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  maxPgConnections: 10 // Use up to 10 connections to the database
});

## Environment Variables

<Steps>
1. `DB_POOL_URL` (Required) - PostgreSQL connection string for the database
2. Set any additional environment variables needed by your worker logic
</Steps>
