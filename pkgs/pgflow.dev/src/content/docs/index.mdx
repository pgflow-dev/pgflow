import { Code, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { stripSetupCode } from './helpers.ts';
import _01_entrypoint from './01_flow_entrypoint.ts?raw';
import _02_parallel_processing from './02_parallel_processing.ts?raw';
import _03_combine from './03_combine.ts?raw';
import _05_trigger from './05_trigger.ts?raw';

## How it works?

Lets code as simplified example - a voice memo processing flow
for AI powered customer support system.

<Steps>

1. Define `RunPayload` and entrypoints (root step)

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_01_entrypoint)} lang="ts"/>

2. Add parallel processing by adding steps that depends on `transcription` results

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_02_parallel_processing)} lang="ts"/>

3. Combine results to create a support ticket

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_03_combine)} lang="ts"/>

4. Deploy your workflow
   
   ```sh
   $ pgflow deploy flows/ProcessVoiceTicket.ts

     -> generating JSON schemas... done
     -> generating graph shape... done
     -> upserting... done

     Your flow was successfully deployed. You can run it now!
   ```

5. Trigger it from browser and receive progress in realtime

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_05_trigger)} lang="ts"/>

</Steps>
