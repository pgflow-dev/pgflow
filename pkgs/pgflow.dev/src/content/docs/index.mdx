import { Code, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { stripSetupCode } from "./helpers.ts";
import _01_entrypoint from "./01_flow_entrypoint.ts.raw?raw";
import _02_parallel_processing from "./02_parallel_processing.ts.raw?raw";
import _03_combine from "./03_combine.ts.raw?raw";
import _05_trigger from "./05_trigger.ts.raw?raw";

## How it works?

Lets code as simplified example - a voice memo processing flow
for AI powered customer support system.

<Steps>

1. #### Define entrypoints

   Define `RunPayload` and root steps (steps without dependencies)

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_01_entrypoint)} lang="ts" />

2. #### Add parallel steps

   Add parallel processing by adding steps that depends on `transcription` results

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_02_parallel_processing)} lang="ts" />

3. #### Use results

   Combine results to create a support ticket

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_03_combine)} lang="ts" />

4. #### Deploy to production

   ```sh
   $ pgflow deploy flows/ProcessVoiceTicket.ts

     -> generating JSON schemas... done
     -> generating graph shape... done
     -> upserting... done

     Your flow was successfully deployed. You can run it now!
   ```

5. #### Trigger from browser

   Triggering flows allows to receive live updates on flow progress by leveraging Supabase Realtime.

   <Code code={stripSetupCode(_05_trigger)} lang="ts" />

6. #### Profit!

   You gain lot more with this simple approach:

   - orchestration is done by postgres, dependant steps start only when dependencies are ready
   - we leverage Supabase Edge Functions to execute handlers - its baked in!
   - you stream live updates/progress back to user browser in realtime
   - end-to-end type safety via JSON schemas generated from your step handlers, all done solely based on shape of the grap and a single type annotation for whole run payload

</Steps>
