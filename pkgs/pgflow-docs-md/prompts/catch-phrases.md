Your job is to create a catch phrase and a description for my project 'pgflow',
base on the description of this project and taking inspiration from a set of catch phrases i collected for my competition.

### My project 'pgflow':

pgflow is a flow engine implemented on top of Postgres and various worker backends
(currently supporting Supabase Edge Functions, pgqueuer, Graphile Worker, and more).
It is transactional - meaning all the state changes of the graph are ACID compliant,
so you only need to write idempotent code and not worry about anything else.

We also have an extremely friendly TypeScript DSL for writing flows, which provides
full type safety, even in the database - we infer types from your graph and use
them as JSON Schemas to validate data in db as check constraints.
