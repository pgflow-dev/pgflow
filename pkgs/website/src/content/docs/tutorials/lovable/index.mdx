**Build reliable, multi-step AI workflows in your Lovable apps.**

pgflow lets you create complex background processes - like AI pipelines, data processing, and multi-step operations - directly in your Supabase backend. When combined with Lovable's AI-powered development, you can build sophisticated apps with robust backend workflows.

## What pgflow enables

With pgflow integrated into your Lovable app, you can:

- **Chain multiple AI operations** - Scrape content, then summarize, then extract tags - all as a single reliable workflow
- **Run steps in parallel** - Process independent operations simultaneously for faster results
- **Handle failures gracefully** - Automatic retries with exponential backoff when APIs fail
- **Track progress** - Full observability into workflow state in your Postgres database
- **Scale horizontally** - Edge Workers auto-scale with your Supabase project

## Installation overview

Installing pgflow in a Lovable project requires a few prompts that you paste into Lovable's chat. The process is designed to be simple and safe.

<Steps>
1. **Install the Control Plane** - Create the pgflow Edge Function that manages flows
2. **Run Migrations** - Apply database migrations and configure secrets via a temporary installer
</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="One-time setup">
  These installation steps only need to be done once per project. After installation, you can define and run workflows entirely through Lovable's chat interface.

## After installation

Once pgflow is installed, you can ask Lovable to:

- Create new workflow definitions in `supabase/flows/`
- Define task functions that call AI APIs
- Compile flows and apply new migrations
- Start workflow runs from your app's frontend

Each workflow you create becomes a reliable, observable background process that Lovable can help you build and iterate on.
