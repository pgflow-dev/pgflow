:::note[About Lovable]
[Lovable](https://lovable.dev) is an AI-powered app builder that runs on Supabase. Since Lovable has no CLI access, this tutorial uses a **manual installation approach** where SQL is executed through the Supabase Dashboard.
:::

This tutorial demonstrates how to use pgflow on Lovable by building a simple greeting workflow with real-time UI updates. You'll learn the manual setup process required for platforms without CLI access.

:::note[Tech Stack]
- **Lovable** - AI-powered app builder
- **Supabase** - Managed database and Edge Functions
- **pgflow** - Postgres-native workflow engine
- **React** - Frontend UI with real-time updates
:::

## What you'll build

You'll create a greeting workflow application that:

<Steps>
1. Takes first name and last name as input through a simple form
2. Executes a two-step workflow:
   - Step 1: Concatenates names into full name
   - Step 2: Creates a personalized greeting
3. Shows real-time progress as each step executes
4. Displays step outputs and final results in the UI
</Steps>

**Key learning points:**
- Manual pgflow installation without CLI
- Creating compilation Edge Functions for flow definitions
- Building real-time UIs with `@pgflow/client`
- Lovable-specific workflow patterns

## Project Structure

    - compile_greet_user/
      - index.ts
    - greet_user_worker/
      - index.ts
- src/
  - components/
    - GreetingFlow.tsx
</FileTree>

## Prerequisites

:::caution[Before you begin]
1. **Lovable account** - Sign up at [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)
2. **Lovable project** - Create a new project (includes managed Supabase)
3. **Basic React/TypeScript knowledge** - Helpful for understanding the code

**Note:** Lovable provides a managed Supabase instance automatically. You'll have full access to Supabase Dashboard for running SQL commands.
:::

## Why manual installation?

Lovable uses AI to generate code but doesn't provide direct CLI access. This means:

- ❌ Cannot run `npx pgflow install`
- ❌ Cannot run `npx pgflow compile`
- ❌ Cannot run `supabase migration up`

Instead, this tutorial shows you how to:

- ✅ Download and execute migration SQL via Supabase Dashboard
- ✅ Create a compilation Edge Function using `compileFlow()` API
- ✅ Set environment variables as Supabase secrets
- ✅ Use Lovable's AI to generate the React UI

## Tutorial approach

This tutorial is structured as **step-by-step prompts to give Lovable**, with explanations of what happens at each stage. Each prompt is crafted to work with Lovable's AI code generation while explaining the underlying pgflow concepts.

:::tip[Using this tutorial]
The prompts in this tutorial follow Lovable best practices:
- **Context first** - Each prompt provides necessary background
- **Explicit instructions** - Clear about what to create and what not to change
- **Reference to docs** - Links to pgflow documentation for deeper understanding
