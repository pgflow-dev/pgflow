Build an AI-powered scraper: fetch → analyze → store.

This tutorial uses **pgflow**, a Postgres-native workflow engine that manages DAG dependencies, state transitions, and execution flow directly in your database. It works with **Edge Worker**, a lightweight runner that executes your workflow tasks, handles retries, and reports results back to pgflow - all running within Supabase Edge Functions. Together, they let you build reliable, observable workflows without extra infrastructure.

## What you'll build

You'll create a practical AI web scraper workflow that:

<Steps>
1. Grabs content from any webpage with built-in error handling
2. Uses GPT-4o to generate summaries and extract relevant tags
3. Runs multiple AI operations in parallel (cutting processing time in half)
4. Stores everything neatly in your Postgres database
5. Auto-retries when things go wrong (because APIs sometimes fail)
</Steps>

## Project Structure

Here's the file structure we'll create:

<FileTree>
- supabase/
  - functions/
    - _tasks/
      - scrapeWebsite.ts
      - summarize.ts
      - extractTags.ts
      - saveToDb.ts
    - _flows/
      - analyze_website.ts
    - analyze_website_worker/
      - index.ts
</FileTree>

:::tip[Why pgflow for AI scraping?]
pgflow handles AI workflow complexity: automatic retries for API failures, parallel processing, and full observability.
Everything runs in your Supabase project - no external infrastructure needed.
:::

## Prerequisites

:::caution[Before you begin]

1. Have a Supabase project initialized locally - see [Supabase Local Development Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development)

2. [Install pgflow](/getting-started/install-pgflow/) - it automatically sets up Edge Worker environment variables
   ```sh
   npx pgflow@latest install
   ```

3. Add your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to `supabase/functions/.env`:
   ```diff
     # supabase/functions/.env
     EDGE_WORKER_DB_URL=postgres://...
     EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL=info
   + OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

   **Important:** Place this `.env` file in the `supabase/functions` directory, not in your project root. Edge Functions specifically look for environment variables in this location.

## What you'll learn

<Steps>
1. Write task functions to fetch and process web content
2. Generate structured data from AI using type-safe schemas
3. Create parallel DAG workflows with the TypeScript DSL
4. Compile flows to SQL and apply migrations
5. Execute workflows using the Edge Worker
