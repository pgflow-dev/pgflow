Build an AI-powered scraper: fetch → analyze → store

## What you'll build

You'll create a web scraper that:

<Steps>
1. Fetches webpage content
2. Analyzes it with OpenAI
3. Runs parallel AI operations  
4. Saves results to your database
</Steps>

## Architecture overview

This tutorial covers building the backend workflow. Future tutorials will add a frontend UI and production deployment.

:::tip[Why pgflow for AI scraping?]
pgflow handles AI workflow complexity: automatic retries for API failures, parallel processing, and full observability.
Everything runs in your Supabase project - no external infrastructure needed.
:::

## Prerequisites

:::caution[Before you begin]

1. [Install pgflow](/getting-started/install-pgflow/) - it automatically sets up Edge Worker environment variables

2. Add your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to `supabase/functions/.env`:
   ```diff
     # supabase/functions/.env
     EDGE_WORKER_DB_URL=postgres://...
     EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL=info
   + OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```
:::

## What you'll learn

<Steps>
1. Setting up database tables for results
2. Creating modular task functions
3. Building parallel DAG workflows
4. Integrating OpenAI with structured outputs  
5. Executing flows in Supabase Edge Functions
</Steps>
