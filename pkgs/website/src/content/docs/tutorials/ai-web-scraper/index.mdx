Build an AI-powered scraper: fetch → parallel AI analysis → store

## What you'll build

In this tutorial series, you'll create an intelligent web scraper that:
- Fetches content from any webpage
- Uses OpenAI to extract meaningful insights
- Processes data with parallel AI operations
- Stores structured results in your database

## Architecture overview

This tutorial is the first in a series. In this part, you'll build the backend workflow - a pgflow DAG that orchestrates web scraping and AI analysis. Future tutorials will cover building a frontend UI and production deployment.

:::tip[Why pgflow for AI scraping?]
pgflow handles the complexity of AI workflows: automatic retries for API failures, parallel processing for multiple AI calls, and full observability of your scraping pipeline.
All orchestration stays in your Supabase project - no external queues or infrastructure needed.
See [How pgflow Works](/concepts/how-pgflow-works/) for details.

## Prerequisites

:::caution[Before you begin]

1. Follow the [install pgflow guide](/getting-started/install-pgflow/) which covers all required steps, versions, and setup instructions. The install command will automatically add the Edge Worker environment variables to your `.env` file.

2. Get an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to your environment:
   ```diff
     # supabase/functions/.env
     EDGE_WORKER_DB_URL=postgres://...
     EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL=info
   + OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

3. Basic familiarity with:
   - TypeScript
   - SQL and PostgreSQL
   - Supabase Edge Functions
