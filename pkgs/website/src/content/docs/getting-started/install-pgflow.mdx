Let's set up pgflow in your Supabase project. This setup needs to be done only once per project.

<NotProductionReady />

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Supabase CLI version **2.0.2** or higher (check with `supabase -v`)
- A local Supabase project set up
- [Deno version **1.45.2**](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.44.2) (required for flow compilation)


If you haven't installed the CLI yet or need to upgrade, see Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
</Aside>

### 1. Install pgflow

You can install pgflow using the automatic installer (recommended) or [manually](/how-to/manual-installation/) if you want more control over the process.

Run the automatic installer with npx:

```bash frame="none"
npx pgflow@latest install
```

The installer will:
- Detect your Supabase project automatically or allow you to specify it manually
- Update your `config.toml` to enable connection pooling
- Copy the required migrations to your migrations folder (with timestamps that ensure they run after your existing migrations)
- Create a functions environment file if needed
- Prevent duplicate migrations if you run the installer multiple times

### 2. Apply configuration changes

Restart your Supabase instance to apply the configuration changes:

```bash frame="none"
npx supabase stop
npx supabase start
```

### 3. Apply migrations

If you haven't already, apply the migrations to create the pgflow schema and tables:

```bash frame="none"
npx supabase migrations up
```

#### What was installed?

The installer set up:

1. **Database schema** - Tables for workflow definitions and runtime state
2. **SQL functions** - Core functions to create, start, and manage workflows
3. **Connection pooling** - Required for Edge Worker operation
4. **Environment variables** - Database connection for Edge Functions
5. **Smart migrations** - Migration files are copied with timestamps that ensure they run after your existing migrations and won't be duplicated if you upgrade pgflow later

<Aside type="note" title="About migrations">
When installing or upgrading pgflow, migrations are copied with special timestamp prefixes that ensure they:
- Run after your existing project migrations
- Won't conflict with your own migrations
- Won't be duplicated if you run the installer multiple times

For example, a pgflow migration like `20250429164909_pgflow_initial.sql` might be installed as `20250430000010_20250429164909_pgflow_initial.sql` to preserve order and prevent conflicts.
</Aside>

Your Supabase project now has everything needed to create and run workflows with pgflow!
