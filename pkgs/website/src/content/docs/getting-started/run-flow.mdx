import NotProductionReady from '@/components/NotProductionReady.astro';

Now that you've defined and compiled your workflow, it's time to execute it!

<NotProductionReady />

In this guide, we'll set up an Edge Worker to process your workflow tasks, trigger your first flow, and observe its execution.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
Before starting, make sure you have:
- Completed the [Create your first flow](/getting-started/create-first-flow/) guide
- Completed the [Edge Worker installation](/edge-worker/getting-started/install-edge-worker/)
</Aside>

## 1. Create a worker function

Create a new Edge Function that will process tasks for your workflow:

```bash frame="none"
npx supabase functions new greet_user_worker
```

Replace contents of `index.ts` file with the following:

```typescript title="supabase/functions/greet_user_worker/index.ts"
import { EdgeWorker } from "jsr:@pgflow/edge-worker";
import GreetUser from '../_flows/greet_user.ts';

// Pass the flow definition to the Edge Worker
EdgeWorker.start(GreetUser);
```

<Aside>
The Edge Worker will:
1. Poll for tasks on the `greet_user` queue
2. Process tasks based on the step slug
3. Return the appropriate result for each step
4. Handle retries if any step fails
</Aside>

### Disable JWT verification

Disable JWT verification for now by editing `supabase/config.toml`:

```diff lang="toml"
  [functions.greet_user_worker]
  enabled = true
- verify_jwt = true
+ verify_jwt = false
  import_map = "./functions/greet_user_worker/deno.json"
```

## 2. Start the Edge Runtime

Start the Edge Runtime to make your worker function available:

```bash frame="none"
npx supabase functions serve
```

This will start the Edge Runtime server but not yet start your worker.
You should see similar output in your terminal:

```
Setting up Edge Functions runtime...
Serving functions on http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>
Using supabase-edge-runtime-1.67.4 (compatible with Deno v1.45.2)
serving the request with supabase/functions/greet_user_worker
```

## 3.  Start your worker

In a new terminal, send an HTTP request to start your worker:

```bash frame="none"
curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/greet_user_worker
```

You should see output in your Edge Runtime terminal indicating the worker has started:

```
[Info] [INFO] worker_id=unknown module=DenoAdapter DenoAdapter logger instance created and working.

[Info] [INFO] worker_id=unknown module=DenoAdapter HTTP Request: null
```

:::caution
If you have troubles starting the worker, make sure you disabled JWT verification in the previous step.

## 4. Trigger your first flow

Now let's start a flow run! Using Supabase Studio:

1. Open Supabase Studio in your browser (typically at http://localhost:54323)
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor**
3. Execute this SQL to start your workflow:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgflow.start_flow(
  flow_slug => 'greet_user',
  input => '{"first_name": "Alice", "last_name": "Smith"}'::jsonb
);
```

This will:
1. Create a new run for your workflow
2. Start the root steps
3. Return information about the new run

The output should look like:

```
run_id        | flow_slug    | status  | input                                         | output | remaining_steps
--------------+--------------+---------+-----------------------------------------------+--------+-----------------
<run_id UUID> | greet_user   | started | {"first_name": "Alice", "last_name": "Smith"} | null   | 2
```

## 5. Monitor execution

Your worker should start processing tasks immediately. You should see log output in the Edge Runtime terminal as each step executes:

```
[Info] [INFO] worker_id=<long UUID> module=ExecutionController Scheduling execution of task 1

[Info] [INFO] worker_id=<long UUID> module=ExecutionController Scheduling execution of task 2
```

You can check the run status using Supabase Studio:

In the SQL Editor, run this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgflow.runs
WHERE flow_slug = 'greet_user'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

As steps complete, you'll see the `remaining_steps` count decrease. When it reaches 0, the run will be marked as `completed`:

```
run_id        | flow_slug    | status    | input                                         | output                              | remaining_steps
--------------+--------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------
<run_id UUID> | greet_user   | completed | {"first_name": "Alice", "last_name": "Smith"} | {"greeting": "Hello, Alice Smith!"} | 0
```

## What's happening behind the scenes?

When you trigger a workflow:

1. **Flow Initialization**:
   - A new run is created in `pgflow.runs`
   - States for all steps are created in `pgflow.step_states`
   - Tasks for root steps are created in `pgflow.step_tasks`
   - Messages are sent to the queue for root steps

2. **Task Processing**:
   - The worker polls the queue for available tasks
   - For each task, it executes the appropriate step handler
   - After successful execution, it calls `pgflow.complete_task`
   - If a step fails, it calls `pgflow.fail_task` which may retry the task

3. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - When a step completes, its dependent steps become eligible for execution
   - The system automatically creates tasks for these dependent steps
   - The process continues until all steps complete or the workflow fails

4. **Run Completion**:
   - When all steps complete, the run is marked as completed
   - The outputs from all leaf steps (those with no dependents) are collected as the run output

## Congratulations!

You've successfully:
- Created a workflow definition
- Compiled it to SQL
- Set up a worker to process tasks
- Triggered a flow execution
- Monitored its progress

This completes the pgflow getting started guide. You now have all the basics needed to start building your own workflows!
