**pgflow** is a Postgres-native workflow engine for defining, managing, and executing DAG-based workflows directly in your Supabase database.

## Core Concepts

At its core, pgflow is built on three key components:

1. **SQL Core Engine** - The heart of pgflow, providing the data model, state machine, and transactional functions that ensure reliable workflow execution

2. **TypeScript DSL** - A developer-friendly domain-specific language for defining workflows with full type safety and IDE autocomplete

3. **Edge Worker** - A task executor that runs on Supabase Edge Functions, processing workflow steps as they become ready

## Who is pgflow for?

pgflow is designed for developers and teams who:

- Use **Supabase** as their backend platform
- Need to process **complex, multi-step workflows**
- Want **visibility and reliability** in background processing
- Prefer **type-safe** development
- Love the idea of keeping everything in **Postgres**

## What can you build with pgflow?

pgflow excels at orchestrating multi-step processing workflows such as:

- **Data processing pipelines**: Extract, transform, and load data
- **Content processing workflows**: Scrape websites, analyze content, generate summaries
- **AI workflows**: Chain multiple AI prompts and combine results
- **User onboarding flows**: Process sign-ups, verify users, set up accounts
- **E-commerce operations**: Order processing, inventory updates, notifications

## Key Features

- **Declarative Workflows**: Define flows and steps in a type-safe TypeScript DSL
- **Dependency Management**: Explicit step dependencies with proper typing
- **Postgres-Native**: Everything runs in your database with strong consistency guarantees
- **Transactional Guarantees**: All state transitions are ACID-compliant
- **At-least-once Delivery**: Messages never get lost thanks to PGMQ integration
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retries with exponential backoff
- **Observability**: Track flow progress via database queries

<Aside type="caution" title="Alpha Status">
  pgflow is currently in alpha status. While the core functionality works,
  the API may change as we gather feedback and improve the system.
  
  Use in production at your own risk, and consider pinning to specific versions 
  to avoid breaking changes.

## How does it work?

pgflow represents workflows as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of steps:

1. Each workflow consists of **steps** connected by **dependencies**
2. Steps without dependencies are **root steps** that start automatically
3. Steps with dependencies only start once all dependencies complete
4. When all steps complete, the workflow run is marked as completed
5. Edge Worker executes the steps by polling for available tasks

## What's next?

Now that you understand what pgflow is, let's continue with the getting started guide:

1. [Install pgflow](/pgflow/getting-started/install-pgflow/) - Set up pgflow in your Supabase project
2. [Create your first flow](/pgflow/getting-started/create-first-flow/) - Define and compile a workflow
3. [Trigger and monitor](/pgflow/getting-started/trigger-and-monitor/) - Start a flow and watch it execute
