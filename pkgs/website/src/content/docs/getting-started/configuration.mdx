pgflow's configuration is divided into two distinct parts, each serving a different purpose in the workflow lifecycle.

pgflow separates configuration into **task execution** settings (how individual steps are executed and retried) and **worker** settings (how the worker processes the entire flow). Task settings are stored in your database and control retry behavior, delays, and timeouts, while worker settings control concurrency, connections, and batching.

<Aside type="note" title="Documentation Structure">
This page covers both pgflow configuration and Edge Worker configuration in one place. Future versions may separate these concerns for clarity.

<Aside title="Zero Configuration" type="tip">
pgflow comes with sensible defaults for all configuration options.

You only need to specify slugs for your flow and steps:

```ts
new Flow({ slug: 'my_flow' })
  .step({ slug: 'step1' }, handler1)
  .step({ slug: 'step2' }, handler2)
```
</Aside>

## Step Execution Options

These settings are defined in your TypeScript flow code and compiled into SQL migrations. They control how individual steps are executed, delayed, and retried. Set defaults at the flow level, override for specific steps. Step-level options are `null` by default, inheriting from flow-level settings.

<Aside type="tip">
After deployment, you can update these settings without recompiling your flow. See [Update Flow Options](/how-to/update-flow-options/) for details.
</Aside>

### Default Configuration

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'my_flow',
  maxAttempts: 3,    // max retry attempts before marking as failed
  baseDelay: 5,      // initial retry delay in seconds
  timeout: 60        // visibility timeout in seconds
  // Note: startDelay is step-level only, not available as a default at flow level
})
```

### `maxAttempts`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `3`

The maximum number of times a task will be attempted before being marked as permanently failed.

```ts
// Flow level
new Flow({ slug: 'my_flow', maxAttempts: 5 })

// Step level (overrides flow default)
.step({ slug: 'my_step', maxAttempts: 7 }, handler)
```

### `baseDelay`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `5`

The initial delay (in seconds) before the first retry. pgflow uses exponential backoff, so subsequent retries will have increasingly longer delays.

```ts
// Flow level
new Flow({ slug: 'my_flow', baseDelay: 2 })

// Step level (overrides flow default)
.step({ slug: 'my_step', baseDelay: 10 }, handler)
```

### `timeout`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `60`

The visibility timeout (in seconds) - how long a task remains invisible to other workers while being processed.

<Aside type="caution" title="Timeout and Task Processing">
Set `timeout` higher than your task's maximum processing time.
  <details>
  <summary>
  Here's why:
  </summary>
  - When a worker picks up a task, it becomes invisible for `timeout` seconds
  - If processing takes longer than `timeout`, the task becomes visible again
  - Other workers can then pick up and process the same task
  - This leads to duplicate processing
  - For example: with `timeout: 30` and a task that takes 45 seconds, the task could be processed twice
  </details>

Currently, pgflow uses timeout only for visibility. In the future, the Edge Worker will also use it to terminate tasks that exceed their timeout.
</Aside>

```ts
// Flow level
new Flow({ slug: 'my_flow', timeout: 120 })

// Step level (overrides flow default)
.step({ slug: 'my_step', timeout: 300 }, handler)
```

### `startDelay`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `0`

Initial delay (in seconds) before task execution.

<Aside type="caution" title="Step-level only">
Unlike other options, `startDelay` cannot be set at the flow level.
<details>
<summary>
Why no flow-level default?
</summary>

Flow-level `startDelay` would create confusing cascading delays in DAG execution:

```
With flow-level startDelay: 10s

Time 0:   Flow starts
Time 10:  Step A starts (waits 10s)
Time 15:  Step A completes
Time 25:  Step B starts (waits 10s after A completes)
Time 30:  Step B completes  
Time 40:  Step C starts (waits 10s after B completes)
```

This results in 40+ seconds of delays, not the expected 10s.

**Better alternatives:**
- **Need uniform delays?** Use a constant as shown below
- **Rate limiting?** Use worker's `maxConcurrent` setting
- **Debug delays?** Add only to specific steps you're debugging
- **Compliance delays?** Make them explicit on relevant steps
</details>

To apply the same delay to multiple steps, use a constant:

```typescript
const RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 2;
flow
  .step({ slug: "api_call_1", startDelay: RATE_LIMIT_DELAY }, handler1)
  .step({ slug: "api_call_2", startDelay: RATE_LIMIT_DELAY }, handler2)
```
</Aside>

### Configuration Examples

#### Flow with Defaults Only

When all steps can use the same configuration:

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'my_flow',
  maxAttempts: 3,    // Default for all steps
  baseDelay: 5,      // Default for all steps
  timeout: 60        // Default for all steps
})
  .step({ slug: 'step1' }, handler1)  // Uses flow defaults
  .step({ slug: 'step2' }, handler2)  // Uses flow defaults
```

#### Mixed Configuration

Override flow defaults for specific steps that need different behavior:

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'analyze_data',
  maxAttempts: 3,    // Flow defaults
  baseDelay: 5,
  timeout: 60
})
  .step({
    slug: 'fetch_data',
    // Uses all flow defaults
  }, fetchHandler)
  .step({
    slug: 'process_data',
    maxAttempts: 5,    // Override: more retries
    timeout: 300       // Override: needs more time
    // baseDelay uses flow default (5)
  }, processHandler)
  .step({
    slug: 'call_api',
    baseDelay: 10,     // Override: longer initial delay
    // maxAttempts and timeout use flow defaults
  }, apiHandler)
```

## Retry Behavior

pgflow uses **exponential backoff** for retries. The delay between attempts is calculated as:

```
delay = baseDelay * 2^attemptCount
```

<Aside type="note">
Unlike the Edge Worker's queue-only mode which supports a `maxDelay` cap, pgflow's retry delays are not capped yet. Delays will continue to double with each attempt, at most `maxAttempts`-times, after which the step and flow are failed permanently
</Aside>

### Retry Delay Examples

Here's how retry delays grow with different base delays:

| Attempt | Delay (baseDelay: 2s) | Delay (baseDelay: 5s) | Delay (baseDelay: 10s) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 1       | 2s                   | 5s                   | 10s                    |
| 2       | 4s                   | 10s                  | 20s                    |
| 3       | 8s                   | 20s                  | 40s                    |
| 4       | 16s                  | 40s                  | 80s                    |
| 5       | 32s                  | 80s                  | 160s                   |
| 6       | 64s                  | 160s                 | 320s                   |
| 7       | 128s                 | 320s                 | 640s                   |

### When Tasks Fail Permanently

A task is marked as permanently failed when:
- It has been attempted `maxAttempts` times
- Each attempt resulted in an error
- The task status changes from `queued` to `failed`
- The error message from the last attempt is stored

## Worker Configuration

These settings control how the EdgeWorker processes tasks from your flows. They're passed when starting the worker and affect performance and resource utilization.

<Aside type="note">
Worker configuration requires redeploying your Edge Function to change, while flow/step configuration can be updated on the fly with SQL queries. See [Update Flow Options](/how-to/update-flow-options/) for details on updating configuration without redeployment.
</Aside>

## Default Worker Configuration

When using pgflow with EdgeWorker, configure the worker's behavior:

```typescript
import { EdgeWorker } from '@pgflow/edge-worker';
import MyFlow from './flows/my_flow.ts';

EdgeWorker.start(MyFlow, {
  // Worker concurrency settings
  maxConcurrent: 10,      // Process up to 10 tasks simultaneously
  maxPgConnections: 4,    // Database connection pool size
  
  // Polling configuration
  batchSize: 10,          // Fetch up to 10 tasks per poll
  maxPollSeconds: 2,      // Long-poll duration
  pollIntervalMs: 100,    // Database polling frequency
});
```

### `maxConcurrent`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `10`

Maximum number of tasks that can be processed simultaneously. Increase for I/O-heavy tasks, decrease for CPU-heavy tasks.

### `maxPgConnections`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `4`

Size of the PostgreSQL connection pool. Should generally be less than `maxConcurrent` since not all tasks need a connection at all times.

### `batchSize`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `10`

Maximum number of tasks to fetch in a single poll operation. Larger batches are more efficient but may lead to uneven work distribution.

### `maxPollSeconds`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `2`

How long to wait for tasks during each poll cycle. Shorter durations ensure more responsive task pickup.

<Aside type="caution">
Keep `maxPollSeconds` at 2 seconds or lower for flow workers to ensure proper heartbeat intervals.
</Aside>

### `pollIntervalMs`
**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `100`

How frequently (in milliseconds) to check the database for new tasks during the poll cycle.

## Complete Examples

These examples show how flow/step configuration and worker configuration work together in real scenarios.

### High-Reliability API Integration

For flows that interact with external APIs that may be temporarily unavailable:

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'sync_external_data',
  maxAttempts: 7,     // More retries for transient failures
  baseDelay: 10,      // Start with 10s, reaching ~20 minutes by attempt 7
  timeout: 300        // 5 minutes for slow APIs
})
```

### Fast Local Processing

For flows that process data locally and should fail fast:

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'process_upload',
  maxAttempts: 2,     // Fail fast - only 1 retry
  baseDelay: 1,       // Minimal delay between attempts
  timeout: 30         // Quick operations
})
```

### Mixed Workload

When different steps have different reliability requirements:

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'data_pipeline',
  maxAttempts: 3,     // Sensible defaults
  baseDelay: 5,
  timeout: 60
})
  .step({
    slug: 'validate_input',
    maxAttempts: 1,   // No retries - validation should not fail
    timeout: 10       // Very quick
  }, validateHandler)
  .step({
    slug: 'fetch_external',
    maxAttempts: 5,   // External API might be flaky
    baseDelay: 10,    // Longer delays for external service
    timeout: 120      // Allow more time
  }, fetchHandler)
  .step({
    slug: 'save_results',
    // Use flow defaults
  }, saveHandler)
```

### Multi-Day Workflow

For workflows that span multiple days with scheduled follow-ups:

```typescript
new Flow({
  slug: 'user_onboarding',
  maxAttempts: 3,
  baseDelay: 5,
  timeout: 60
})
  .step({
    slug: 'send_welcome_email',
    // Executes immediately
  }, sendWelcomeHandler)
  .step({
    slug: 'send_day_3_tips',
    startDelay: 259200,  // 3 days (3 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    timeout: 120
  }, sendTipsHandler)
  .step({
    slug: 'send_week_review',
    startDelay: 604800,  // 7 days after previous step
    timeout: 120
  }, sendReviewHandler)
```
