Now that we've defined our flow, we need to register it in the database. pgflow provides a CLI tool that compiles your TypeScript flow definition into SQL migrations that can be applied to your Supabase database.

## What is compilation?

The pgflow compilation process:

1. Analyzes your TypeScript flow definition
2. Extracts information about steps, dependencies, and options
3. Generates SQL commands that register the flow and its structure in your database
4. Creates a migration file that can be applied to your database

This is an essential step because pgflow's runtime executes flows based on their database representation, not the TypeScript code directly.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
Before continuing, make sure you have:
- Completed the [flow definition](/getting-started/create-first-flow/) from the previous step
- The Supabase CLI installed and configured
- Deno version 1.45.x or higher
</Aside>

### 1. Compile the flow to SQL

Run the pgflow compile command, pointing to your flow definition file:

```bash frame="none"
npx pgflow@latest compile supabase/functions/_flows/greet_user.ts
```

This will:
- Parse your TypeScript flow definition
- Extract the flow structure, step dependencies, and configuration
- Generate SQL commands to register the flow in the database
- Create a timestamped migration file in your Supabase migrations folder

You should see output like this:

```
✓ Successfully compiled flow to SQL
✓ Migration file created: supabase/migrations/20250505120000_create_greet_user_flow.sql
```

### 2. Examine the generated SQL

Let's look at what got generated. Open the migration file in your editor:

```bash frame="none"
cat supabase/migrations/20250505120000_create_greet_user_flow.sql
```

The migration file contains SQL commands that:

1. Create the flow definition
2. Add each step with its configuration
3. Define dependencies between steps

The generated SQL looks like this:

```sql
SELECT pgflow.create_flow('greet_user');
SELECT pgflow.add_step('greet_user', 'full_name');
SELECT pgflow.add_step('greet_user', 'greeting', ARRAY['full_name']);
```

This SQL representation is what the pgflow runtime system uses to execute your workflow.

### 3. Apply the migration

Now that we have the SQL migration, we need to apply it to our database:

```bash frame="none"
npx supabase migrations up
```

This will execute the SQL migration and register your flow definition in the database.

If successful, you should see output like:

```
Applying migration 20250505120000_create_greet_user_flow.sql...done
```
