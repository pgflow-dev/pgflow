This guide explains the current process for deploying and maintaining workers in hosted environment.

:::note
Running Edge Worker on Supabase.com currently requires a few additional setup steps.
Thanks to ongoing collaboration with the Supabase team, these requirements will be simplified in future releases.

## Deploying workers

Workers are just regular Edge Functions that run for few minutes and auto-respawn
when CPU or Wall clock limits are reached (read more on those [Limits | Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/limits)).

Deploying new version is straightforward - you just update worker code
and call `npx supabase functions deploy worker-name` to deploy it.

When deploying a new version of your worker, be aware of the following:

Currently, deploying a new version **does not automatically terminate** the previous version.
This behavior will be improved in future releases.

## Zero-Downtime Deployment Process

### Understanding Worker Deprecation

When you deploy a new version, old workers continue running until they hit resource limits (up to 150s on free tier, 400s on paid). This creates overlap where both versions process tasks simultaneously.

pgflow provides worker deprecation to solve this - old workers can be marked as deprecated and will:
- Stop accepting new work
- Complete their current tasks

Workers check their deprecation status every 5 seconds during heartbeat and automatically stop when `deprecated_at` is set.

### Step-by-Step Deployment

<Steps>

1. **Deploy your new worker version**
   
   Update your worker code and deploy to Supabase:
   
   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase functions deploy your-worker-name
   ```

2. **Start the new worker**
   
   Make an HTTP request to start the new worker instance:
   
   ```bash frame="none"
   curl -X POST "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/your-worker-name" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
   ```

3. **Deprecate old workers**
   
   Mark old workers for graceful shutdown:
   
   ```sql
   UPDATE pgflow.workers 
   SET deprecated_at = NOW() 
   WHERE function_name = 'your-worker-name'
     AND deprecated_at IS NULL;
   ```

4. **Monitor the transition**
   
   Watch workers gracefully shut down (takes ~5-10 seconds):
   
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     function_name,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deprecated_at IS NULL) as active_workers,
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deprecated_at IS NOT NULL) as deprecated_workers
   FROM pgflow.workers
   WHERE last_heartbeat_at > now() - interval '6 seconds'
   GROUP BY function_name;
   ```

</Steps>

This process ensures immediate cutover to your new code while allowing in-flight tasks to complete gracefully.

## Starting Workers

Just like in local development, workers are started with a simple HTTP request.
However, you need to pass Authorization header with your ANON_KEY when calling function.
Consult this Supabase Docs page for details: [Invoking remote functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/deploy#invoking-remote-functions)

After the initial request, the worker will auto-respawn if terminated.

## Stopping Workers

Currently, there's no built-in way to gracefully stop a running worker.
You need to remove it from the Supabase Dashboard and wait for its CPU or clock limits to be reached
for it to stop.

**This will change in future releases.**

## Ensuring Worker Availability

To ensure your worker stays active, it's recommended to use Cron to ping
your worker edge function every few seconds.
This is recommended in case there are any bugs in the respawn process,
which currently is triggered from withing the worker that is shutting down.

Use this Supabase guide [Invoking Supabase Function ever few seconds](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cron/quickstart#invoke-supabase-edge-function-every-30-seconds).
but use `5 seconds` instead of `30 seconds`.

:::note
Make sure to **set your own ANON key** in the `Authorization` header!
