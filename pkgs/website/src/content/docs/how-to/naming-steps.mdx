description: Best practices for naming steps in your pgflow flows

Step naming is an important design decision that affects workflow readability and maintainability. After analyzing multiple pgflow projects, these patterns have proven effective.

## Recommended approach: Hybrid naming

- Use **nouns** for steps that produce data other steps depend on
- Use **verb-noun** combinations for terminal actions or utility steps

```ts
// Data-producing steps use nouns
.step({ slug: "website" }, ...)
.step({ slug: "summary", dependsOn: ["website"] }, ...)

// Terminal action step uses verb-noun
.step({ slug: "saveToDb", dependsOn: ["summary"] }, ...)
```

## Why this works well

1. When accessing data from dependent steps, nouns create more intuitive property access:
   ```ts
   // Clean and reads naturally
   ({ website }) => summarizeWithAI(website.content)
   ```

2. Terminal steps that don't have any dependents benefit from action-oriented naming that clearly describes what they're doing

## Use camelCase for step slugs

```ts
.step({ slug: "websiteContent" }, ...)   // Correct
.step({ slug: "website_content" }, ...)  // Avoid
```

Step slugs are used as identifiers in TypeScript and must match exactly when referenced in dependency arrays. Following JavaScript conventions with camelCase helps maintain consistency.

While this guide recommends the hybrid pattern, the most important thing is consistency within your project. Document the chosen convention and apply it throughout the codebase.
