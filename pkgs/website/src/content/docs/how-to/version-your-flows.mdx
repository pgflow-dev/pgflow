## Current Compilation Limitations

**Important:** The current version of pgflow's compiler has several limitations:

1. Always creates a **new migration file** for any changes
2. Does not provide automatic update functionality for existing flows
3. Cannot safely change step dependencies or flow structure

For any changes to an existing flow, you must:
- Manually handle migration files
- For non-breaking changes, manually update using SQL commands

:::danger[Prohibited Changes]
DO NOT attempt to change these aspects of an existing flow:
- Step slugs
- Dependencies between steps
- Adding or removing steps
- Altering the flow's input type structure

These changes will break in-progress runs and cause data compatibility issues.

## Understanding Safe vs. Breaking Changes

Before making changes to your flows, understand which modifications are safe:

| Safe Changes | Breaking Changes |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Modifying step implementation | Adding/removing steps |
| Adjusting retry parameters | Changing step dependencies |
| Updating timeout values | Modifying input/output types |
| Bug fixes within steps | Changing step slug names |

## Version Management Strategy

pgflow uses the flow's `slug` as its identifier, so to create a new version:

1. **Create a new flow definition file** with a versioned slug (e.g., `greet_user_v2.ts`)
2. **Manually manage migration files**:
   - Keep previous migration files for existing runs
   - Create new migrations for the new flow version

```typescript
// greet_user_v2.ts
export default new Flow<Input>({
  slug: 'greet_user_v2',  // Note the versioned slug
  // ...configuration
})
```

## Updating Non-Breaking Configuration Options

For non-breaking changes like adjusting retry settings or timeouts, you must manually update the database with SQL commands.

We've created a detailed guide on [how to update flow options](/how-to/update-flow-options/) that covers:
- All available configuration options
- SQL commands for updating flows and steps
- Best practices for maintaining compatibility

For any non-breaking changes to existing flows, refer to this guide rather than recompiling.
