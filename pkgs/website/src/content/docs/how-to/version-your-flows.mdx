## Current Compilation Limitations

**Important:** The current version of pgflow's compiler has several limitations:

1. Always creates a **new migration file** for any changes
2. Does not provide automatic update functionality for existing flows
3. Cannot safely change step dependencies or flow structure

For any changes to an existing flow, you must:
- Manually handle migration files
- For non-breaking changes, manually update using SQL commands

:::danger[Prohibited Changes]
DO NOT attempt to change these aspects of an existing flow:
- Step slugs
- Dependencies between steps
- Adding or removing steps
- Altering the flow's input type structure

These changes will break in-progress runs and cause data compatibility issues.

## Understanding Safe vs. Breaking Changes

Before making changes to your flows, understand which modifications are safe:

| Safe Changes | Breaking Changes |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| ✅ Modifying step implementation | ❌ Adding/removing steps |
| ✅ Adjusting retry parameters | ❌ Changing step dependencies |
| ✅ Updating timeout values | ❌ Modifying input/output types |
| ✅ Bug fixes within steps | ❌ Changing step slug names |

## Version Management Strategy

pgflow uses the flow's `slug` as its identifier, so to create a new version:

1. **Create a new flow definition file** with a versioned slug (e.g., `greet_user_v2.ts`)
2. **Compile and apply the new version** using the normal compilation process

```typescript
// greet_user_v2.ts
export default new Flow<Input>({
  slug: 'greet_user_v2',  // Note the versioned slug
  // ...configuration
})
```

### Compiling the new version

Once you've created your new flow file with a versioned slug, simply [compile it to SQL](/getting-started/compile-to-sql/) like any other flow:

```bash frame="none"
npx pgflow@latest compile supabase/functions/_flows/greet_user_v2.ts
npx supabase migrations up --local
```

The compilation process will:
- Generate a new migration file for the new flow version
- Register the new flow alongside the existing version in the database
- Leave the previous version completely untouched

You don't need to manually manage migration files or think about previous versions - each flow version is a separate entity identified by its unique slug.

## Updating Non-Breaking Configuration Options

For non-breaking changes like adjusting retry settings or timeouts, you must manually update the database with SQL commands.

We've created a detailed guide on [how to update flow options](/how-to/update-flow-options/) that covers:
- All available configuration options
- SQL commands for updating flows and steps
- Best practices for maintaining compatibility

For any non-breaking changes to existing flows, refer to this guide rather than recompiling.

## Development Workarounds

During development, if you need to make breaking changes to a flow, you can [delete the flow and its data](/how-to/delete-flow-and-data/) entirely and start fresh. This approach deletes all flow data and should never be used in production.
