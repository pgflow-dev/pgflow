## Pruning Old Records

As your application runs more and more workflows, your pgflow tables will accumulate historical data. While this data is valuable for auditing and debugging, keeping it indefinitely can lead to performance degradation and increased storage costs. This guide explains how to implement a maintenance routine to prune old records from your pgflow tables.

<Aside type="note" title="What gets pruned">
The pruning function removes completed and failed records from the following tables:
- `pgflow.workers` - Inactive worker records
- `pgflow.step_tasks` - Completed or failed task records
- `pgflow.step_states` - Completed or failed step state records
- `pgflow.runs` - Completed or failed workflow run records
</Aside>

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Using pg_cron (Recommended)

For Postgres databases that support the [pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron) extension, you can schedule automatic pruning:

<Steps>
1. Install the pruning function by adding the SQL below to a migration file

2. Create a scheduled job using pg_cron

    ```sql
    -- Schedule weekly pruning (every Sunday at 2 AM)
    -- This keeps 28 days of data (adjust as needed)
    SELECT cron.schedule(
      'pgflow-prune-weekly',
      '0 2 * * 0', -- cron expression: minute hour day month weekday
      'SELECT * FROM pgflow.prune_old_records(28)'
    );
    ```

3. Verify the scheduled job

    ```sql
    -- Check that the job is scheduled
    SELECT * FROM cron.job;
    ```
</Steps>

### Option 2: Manual Execution

If you don't have pg_cron available, you can:

<Steps>
1. Install the pruning function by adding the SQL below to a migration file

2. Run the function manually or from your application code when needed:

    ```sql
    -- Keep 90 days of records
    SELECT * FROM pgflow.prune_old_records(90);
    -- Returns the count of deleted records from each table
    ```
</Steps>

## The Pruning Function

Add this SQL function to a migration file in your project:

<Code lang="sql" code={pruningFunctionCode} />

<Aside type="tip" title="Performance Impact">
For very large pgflow tables, consider running the pruning function during off-peak hours as it performs DELETE operations that could impact database performance.
