During development, you may want to completely remove a flow and all its associated data to start fresh. This operation is destructive and should **never be used in production**.

<Aside type="danger" title="Data Loss Warning">
This permanently deletes all flow data including:
- All run history
- All queued and archived messages
- All task outputs
- All flow definitions
</Aside>

## When to Use This

This approach is useful when:
- You need to make breaking changes during development
- You want to clean up test data
- You're iterating on flow structure and need a fresh start

For production environments, always use [versioned flows](/how-to/version-flows/) instead (e.g., `my_flow_v1`, `my_flow_v2`) to safely deploy new versions while maintaining complete flow history.

## Using the Delete Function

pgflow includes a delete function that accepts a flow slug parameter:

```sql
pgflow.delete_flow_and_data(flow_slug TEXT)
```

Example:
```sql
-- Delete a specific flow
SELECT pgflow.delete_flow_and_data('your_flow_slug');
```

## Installing the Function

To install this function, run the following SQL directly in your database using psql or Supabase Studio. This approach helps prevent accidentally deploying this destructive function to production.

<Aside type="caution">
This function is not yet included in the default pgflow migrations since pgflow is still in early development and I'm learning how users interact with it. It has been thoroughly unit tested, but you'll need to manually add it to your project as shown in the <a href="#the-delete-function">Delete Function</a> section below.
</Aside>

## The Delete Function

Run this SQL to install the delete function:

<Code lang="sql" code={deleteFlowFunctionCode} />

## After Deleting

Once you've deleted the flow:

1. You can compile and deploy a fresh version without conflicts
2. The flow slug becomes available for reuse
3. All historical data is permanently lost
