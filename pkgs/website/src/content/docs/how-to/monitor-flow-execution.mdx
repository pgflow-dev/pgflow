This guide explains how to monitor your pgflow workflows during and after execution using SQL queries.

## View workflow run status

To check the status of your workflow runs, query the `pgflow.runs` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgflow.runs
WHERE flow_slug = 'your_flow_slug'
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This shows the most recent runs with their status, inputs, outputs, and remaining steps:

```
run_id        | flow_slug    | status    | input                | output                   | remaining_steps
--------------+--------------+-----------+----------------------+--------------------------+-----------------
<run_id UUID> | your_flow    | completed | {"param": "value"}   | {"result": "Success!"}   | 0
<run_id UUID> | your_flow    | started   | {"param": "value2"}  | null                     | 3
<run_id UUID> | your_flow    | failed    | {"param": "value3"}  | null                     | 5
```

Run statuses include:
- `started`: The run has been created and is executing steps
- `completed`: All steps have completed successfully
- `failed`: One or more steps have failed after max retries

## View step details for a specific run

To check the status of individual steps within a run:

```sql

SELECT ss.step_slug, ss.status, ss.remaining_deps, ss.remaining_tasks, st.output
FROM pgflow.step_states ss
LEFT JOIN
    pgflow.step_tasks st
    ON
        ss.run_id = st.run_id
        AND ss.step_slug = st.step_slug
        AND st.status = 'completed'
WHERE ss.run_id = 'your-run-id-here';
```

This shows the status of each step with its output:

```
step_slug    | status    | remaining_deps | remaining_tasks | output
-------------+-----------+----------------+----------------+---------------------------
process_data | completed | 0              | 0              | {"processed": true}
send_email   | completed | 0              | 0              | "Email sent successfully"
final_step   | created   | 2              | 1              | null
```

Step statuses include:
- `created`: The step has been created but may be waiting for dependencies
- `started`: The step has started execution (all dependencies are complete)
- `completed`: The step has completed successfully
- `failed`: The step has failed after max retries

## Monitor active tasks

To see all tasks that are currently active (queued or being processed):

```sql
SELECT
  run_id,
  step_slug,
  status,
  attempts_count,
  message_id,
  queued_at,
  started_at,
  last_worker_id
FROM pgflow.step_tasks
WHERE status IN ('queued', 'started')
ORDER BY queued_at ASC;
```

This shows active tasks at different stages:

```
run_id   | step_slug    | status  | attempts_count | message_id | queued_at           | started_at          | last_worker_id
---------+--------------+---------+---------------+------------+--------------------+--------------------+---------------
<run_id> | process_data | queued  | 1              | 123456     | 2023-05-01 12:00:00| null               | null
<run_id> | send_email   | started | 1              | 123457     | 2023-05-01 12:01:00| 2023-05-01 12:02:00| worker-uuid-123
```

Active task statuses:
- `queued`: Task is ready to run, waiting for a worker to claim it
- `started`: Task is currently being processed by a worker (with `started_at` timestamp and `worker_id`)

## Get execution timeline for a run

To see how long each step took to execute:

```sql
SELECT
  step_slug,
  status,
  created_at,
  started_at,
  completed_at,
  failed_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (COALESCE(completed_at, failed_at) - started_at)) AS duration_seconds
FROM pgflow.step_states
WHERE run_id = 'your-run-id-here'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

## Troubleshoot failed steps

When a step fails, you can check for error details:

```sql
SELECT
  ss.step_slug,
  st.attempts_count,
  st.error_message,
  st.queued_at,
  st.failed_at
FROM pgflow.step_states ss
JOIN pgflow.step_tasks st ON
  ss.run_id = st.run_id AND
  ss.step_slug = st.step_slug
WHERE ss.run_id = 'your-run-id-here'
AND ss.status = 'failed';
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Flow Visualization">
In a real application, you'd likely want to create a dashboard to visualize your flows and their execution status.

pgflow stores all the information needed to build rich visualizations of your workflow execution, including:
- Step dependencies
- Execution times
- Retry attempts
- Inputs and outputs

This data is available through SQL queries to the pgflow schema tables.

## View step dependencies

To understand the structure of your workflow and the dependencies between steps:

```sql
SELECT
  steps.step_slug,
  array_agg(deps.dep_slug) as dependencies
FROM pgflow.steps steps
LEFT JOIN pgflow.deps deps ON
  steps.flow_slug = deps.flow_slug AND
  steps.step_slug = deps.step_slug
WHERE steps.flow_slug = 'your_flow_slug'
GROUP BY steps.step_slug;
```
