Flow definitions in pgflow are fundamentally immutable in structure. For structural changes like adding steps or changing dependencies, create a new flow version instead (see [Version Your Flows](/how-to/version-flows/)). This guide focuses only on runtime configuration options you can safely update.

## Updatable Options

You can safely modify these runtime options without creating a new flow version:

| Option | Description | Default | Scope |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| `opt_max_attempts` | Max retry attempts | 3 | Flow & Steps |
| `opt_base_delay` | Base retry delay (seconds) | 1 | Flow only |
| `opt_timeout` | Max execution time (seconds) | 60 | Flow & Steps |

<Aside title="About opt_timeout" type="caution">
Currently, `opt_timeout` is only used to set the visibility timeout of messages in the queue. You should set this value to be higher than the maximum time a job can possibly run. If processing takes longer than the timeout, the message will become visible again and may be processed by another worker, leading to duplicate processing.

In the future, the Edge Worker will use abort signals to terminate jobs past their timeout, but currently, it does not do this.

For more details on visibility timeouts, see the [Edge Worker Configuration](/edge-worker/getting-started/configuration/#visibilitytimeout) documentation.

## Configuration System

pgflow uses a two-level configuration approach:
- **Flow-level options**: Set defaults for all steps in the flow
- **Step-level options**: Override flow defaults for specific steps

## Updating Options Manually

Since the compiler doesn't support updating existing flows, you must manually update options in the database:

### Flow Level (Affects All Steps)
```sql
UPDATE pgflow.flows
SET opt_max_attempts = 5, opt_timeout = 10, opt_base_delay = 2
WHERE flow_slug = 'your_flow_slug';
```

### Step Level (Overrides Flow Defaults)
```sql
UPDATE pgflow.steps
SET opt_max_attempts = 3, opt_timeout = 30
WHERE flow_slug = 'your_flow_slug' AND step_slug = 'your_step_slug';
```

## Example: Increasing Retries for API Calls
```sql
-- Check current settings
SELECT step_slug, opt_max_attempts FROM pgflow.steps WHERE flow_slug = 'analyze_website';

-- Update API call step to retry more
UPDATE pgflow.steps SET opt_max_attempts = 5
WHERE flow_slug = 'analyze_website' AND step_slug = 'website';
```

After updating options in the database, remember to update your flow definition code to keep them in sync.
