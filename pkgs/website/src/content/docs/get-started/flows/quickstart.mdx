See pgflow in action using the GreetUser flow scaffolded during installation.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Completed the [pgflow installation](/get-started/installation/)
- Supabase running locally (`npx supabase start`)
- Migrations applied (`npx supabase migrations up`)
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. ### Start edge functions

   Open a terminal and start the edge functions server:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt
   ```

   Keep this terminal open.

   See [Local Development](/build/local-development/) for cleaner output.

2. ### Start the worker

   In a **new terminal**, send an HTTP request to start the worker:

   ```bash frame="none"
   curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/greet-user-worker
   ```

   You only need to curl once - pgflow [auto-compiles](/concepts/compilation/) and [keeps workers running](/concepts/worker-lifecycle/).

3. ### Trigger your first flow

   Open Supabase Studio (http://localhost:54323), go to the **SQL Editor**, and run:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pgflow.start_flow(
     flow_slug => 'greetUser',
     input => '{"firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Smith"}'::jsonb
   );
   ```

   After a moment, query the run status:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pgflow.runs
   WHERE flow_slug = 'greetUser'
   ORDER BY started_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   You should see `status: completed` with output:

   ```json
   {"greeting": "Hello, Alice Smith!"}
   ```

</Steps>

## What just happened?

<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>

1. **Auto-compilation** - The worker detected the flow wasn't in the database and compiled it automatically
2. **Worker started** - The worker began polling for tasks on the `greetUser` queue
3. **Steps executed** - Steps ran in dependency order: `fullName` first, then `greeting` used its output

</details>

## Iterating on your flow

Just change your flow code - the rest is automatic:

<Steps>

1. Edge runtime detects code changes and restarts the function
2. pgflow cron triggers the function via HTTP
3. Worker starts, detects the new shape, deletes the old flow, and compiles the new one

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
Recompiling **deletes the existing flow and all its run data**. This is intentional for fast local iteration. See [Compilation](/concepts/compilation/) for details.
