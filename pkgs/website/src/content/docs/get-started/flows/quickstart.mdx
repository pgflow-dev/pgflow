See pgflow in action using the GreetUser flow scaffolded during installation.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Completed the [pgflow installation](/get-started/installation/)
- Supabase running locally (`npx supabase start`)
- Migrations applied (`npx supabase migrations up`)
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. ### Start edge functions

   Open a terminal and start the edge functions server:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase functions serve
   ```

   Keep this terminal open.

2. ### Compile the flow

   In a **new terminal**, compile the GreetUser flow:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx pgflow@latest compile greetUser
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   Successfully compiled flow to SQL
   Migration file created: supabase/migrations/..._create_greetUser_flow.sql
   ```

3. ### Apply the migration

   Apply the migration to register the flow in your database:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase migrations up
   ```

4. ### Start the worker

   Send an HTTP request to start the scaffolded worker:

   ```bash frame="none"
   curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/greet-user-worker
   ```

   You should see worker activity in the edge functions terminal.

5. ### Trigger your first flow

   Open Supabase Studio (http://localhost:54323), go to the **SQL Editor**, and run:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pgflow.start_flow(
     flow_slug => 'greetUser',
     input => '{"firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Smith"}'::jsonb
   );
   ```

6. ### Check the result

   After a moment, query the run status:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pgflow.runs
   WHERE flow_slug = 'greetUser'
   ORDER BY started_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   You should see `status: completed` with output:

   ```json
   {"greeting": "Hello, Alice Smith!"}
   ```

</Steps>

## What just happened?

<details>
<summary>Expand for details</summary>

1. **Compilation** converted your TypeScript flow to a SQL migration
2. **Migration** registered the flow structure in Postgres
3. **Worker** began polling for tasks on the `greetUser` queue
4. **Steps executed** in dependency order: `fullName` ran first, then `greeting` used its output

The GreetUser flow demonstrates the core pgflow pattern - steps with dependencies that pass data between them.
