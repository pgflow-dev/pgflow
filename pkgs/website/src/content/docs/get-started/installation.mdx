Let's set up pgflow in your Supabase project. This setup needs to be done only once per project.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Supabase CLI version **2.0.2** or higher (check with `supabase -v`)
- A local Supabase project set up
- [Deno version **1.45.2 or higher**](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.45.2) (2.x also supported, required for flow compilation)


If you haven't installed the CLI yet or need to upgrade, see Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. ### Install pgflow

   Run the installer with npx:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx pgflow@latest install
   ```

   Want to understand what's happening? See the [manual installation guide](/reference/manual-installation/).

2. ### Apply configuration changes

   Restart your Supabase instance to apply the configuration changes:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase stop
   npx supabase start
   ```

3. ### Apply migrations

   Apply the migrations to create the pgflow schema and tables:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase migrations up
   ```

</Steps>

Your Supabase project now has everything needed to create and run workflows with pgflow!
