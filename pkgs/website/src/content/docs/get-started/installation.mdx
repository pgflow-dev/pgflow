Let's set up pgflow in your Supabase project. This setup needs to be done only once per project.

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Supabase CLI version **2.50.3** or higher (check with `supabase -v`)
- A local Supabase project set up

If you haven't installed the CLI yet or need to upgrade, see Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. ### Install pgflow

   Run the installer with npx:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx pgflow@latest install
   ```

   <Aside type="note" title="What got installed?">
   The installer creates a `pgflow` edge function that handles flow compilation. You'll register your flows in this function and it will compile them to SQL migrations.
   </Aside>

   Want to understand what's happening? See the [manual installation guide](/reference/manual-installation/).

2. ### Apply configuration changes

   Restart your Supabase instance to apply the configuration changes:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase stop
   npx supabase start
   ```

3. ### Apply migrations

   Apply the migrations to create the pgflow schema and tables:

   ```bash frame="none"
   npx supabase migrations up
   ```

</Steps>

Your Supabase project now has everything needed to create and run flows with pgflow!
