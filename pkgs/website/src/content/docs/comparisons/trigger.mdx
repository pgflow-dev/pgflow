## Features

| Technical Criteria | pgflow | Trigger.dev |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Architecture Model** | Database-centric orchestration | Background job execution and orchestration |
| **Infrastructure Requirements** | Zero additional (just Supabase) | Hosted service with dashboard or self-hosted |
| **Workflow Definition** | TypeScript DSL with explicit dependencies | TypeScript functions with tasks and subtasks |
| **Supabase Integration** | Built-in | Requires manual configuration |
| **Type System** | End-to-end type safety | Standard TypeScript typing |
| **Failure Handling** | Automatic per-step retries | Configurable per-task retries |
| **Event Handling** | No explicit hooks | Rich hooks (init, cleanup, onSuccess, onFailure) |
| **Developer Experience** | DSL-based API | Function-based API with lifecycle hooks |
| **Maturity Level** | Active development | Production-ready |
| **Monitoring Tools** | SQL queries for visibility | Comprehensive web dashboard |
| **Execution Structure** | Database-driven DAG | Task/subtask hierarchy |
| **Concurrency Management** | Simple per-flow limits | Advanced queues and limits |
| **Scheduling Capabilities** | Built into Supabase (pg_cron) | Built-in cron scheduler |

Both systems provide reliable task execution with proper retries and error handling. The key difference is who controls the workflow orchestration: the database (pgflow) or the task execution platform (Trigger.dev).

## When to Choose

### pgflow
- **Committed to Supabase** - Want a workflow solution that lives entirely inside your Supabase project
- **DAG-based workflows** - Need to express complex data dependencies as a directed acyclic graph
- **SQL visibility** - Prefer direct database access to monitor workflow state via SQL queries
- **Lightweight deployment** - Need minimal infrastructure with no additional services to maintain
- **PostgreSQL transactions** - Want to leverage database transactions throughout workflows
- **Edge Function execution** - Want to run workflow steps as Supabase Edge Functions
- **Explicit data flow** - Prefer declarative data dependencies over imperative control flow

### Trigger.dev
- **User-friendly dashboard** - Need comprehensive UI for monitoring and managing workflow runs
- **Task relationships** - Prefer parent-child task relationships over explicit dependency graphs
- **Advanced concurrency** - Need sophisticated queuing with per-tenant concurrency controls
- **Rich lifecycle hooks** - Want init, cleanup, onSuccess, and onFailure lifecycle hooks
- **Delay capabilities** - Need to schedule tasks for future execution with precise timing
- **Framework integration** - Desire tight integration with Next.js and other frameworks
- **Immediate production use** - Need a mature, battle-tested solution ready for production

## Code Examples

### pgflow

pgflow puts **PostgreSQL at the center** of your workflow orchestration. Workflows are defined in TypeScript but **compiled to SQL migrations** with all orchestration logic running **directly in the database**. The database decides when tasks are ready to execute based on explicit dependencies.

```typescript
// In pgflow, the database orchestrates the workflow
new Flow<{ url: string }>({
  slug: 'analyze_website',
})
  .step(
    { slug: 'extract' },
    async (input) => /* extract data */
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'transform', dependsOn: ['extract'] },
    async (input) => /* transform using extract results */
  );
```

### Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev provides a task-based system where you define individual tasks with explicit handlers and lifecycle hooks. Tasks can be triggered manually or from other tasks.

```typescript
// In Trigger.dev, you define tasks with handlers and hooks
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const extractData = task({
  id: "extract-data",
  // Optional initialization hook
  init: async (payload) => {
    return { client: createApiClient() };
  },
  run: async (payload: { url: string }, { init }) => {
    // Use resources from init
    return await init.client.fetch(payload.url);
  }
});

// Parent task that coordinates workflow
export const analyzeWebsite = task({
  id: "analyze-website",
  run: async (payload: { url: string }) => {
    // Extract data and wait for result
    const data = await extractData.triggerAndWait({
      url: payload.url
    }).unwrap();

    // Process data and return result
    return processData(data);
  }
});
```

## Similarities

Both systems provide reliable execution of workflow tasks:

- Both can properly handle retries and error recovery
- Both track execution state and progress
- Both provide typing and type safety
- Both support parallel execution of independent tasks
- Both allow the scheduling/triggering of workflow execution

The difference is architectural:
- pgflow: PostgreSQL orchestrates when steps run based on dependencies
- Trigger.dev: Platform manages task execution with flexible triggering options

## Integration with Supabase

### pgflow
- **Native integration** - Built specifically for Supabase ecosystem
- **Zero infrastructure** - Uses Supabase Edge Functions and PostgreSQL
- **Simple setup** - Single command (`npx pgflow install`) sets up all required components
- **Direct database access** - All workflow state directly accessible in your Supabase database

### Trigger.dev
- **Possible integration** - Can work with Supabase but not specifically designed for it
- **Additional infrastructure** - Requires either hosted service or self-hosted instance
- **Connection** - Requires connecting Supabase to Trigger.dev infrastructure
- **Separate dashboard** - Uses its own dashboard for monitoring and management
