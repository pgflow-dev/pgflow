## Key Differences

When comparing pgflow to other workflow systems, these are the most important architectural differences:

1. **Database-Centric Orchestration** - pgflow puts PostgreSQL at the center, using it not just for storage but for orchestration logic
1. **Supabase Integration** - Built specifically for the Supabase ecosystem with zero additional infrastructure
1. **Explicit Data Dependencies** - Flow steps connect through explicit data dependencies rather than procedural control flow
1. **PostgreSQL State Storage** - All workflow state remains directly queryable in your Supabase database

These guides help you decide which tool is best for your specific use case based on your requirements, preferences, and existing infrastructure.
