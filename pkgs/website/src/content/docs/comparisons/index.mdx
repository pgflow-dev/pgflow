This section compares pgflow to other workflow orchestration systems, helping you understand the architectural differences, trade-offs, and when to choose each approach.

## Two Approaches to Workflows

Workflow systems use one of two approaches:

### Explicit Graph (pgflow)

You define the complete workflow structure upfront. The system knows all steps and their dependencies before execution starts.

```typescript
// The entire graph is defined upfront
new Flow({ slug: 'processOrder' })
  .step({ slug: 'validate' }, async (input) => { /* ... */ })
  .step({ slug: 'charge', dependsOn: ['validate'] }, async (input) => { /* ... */ });
```

### Implicit Graph (DBOS, Inngest, Trigger.dev, Vercel Workflows)

The workflow structure emerges as your code executes. Steps are discovered at runtime, checkpointed, and can be replayed with memoized results.

```typescript
// The graph emerges as code runs
async function processOrder(input) {
  "use workflow"; // or @DBOS.workflow() or step.run()
  const validated = await validate(input);  // Step 1 discovered here
  const charged = await charge(validated);   // Step 2 discovered here
}
```

**Key difference:** Explicit graphs are compiled/analyzed before execution. Implicit graphs are discovered during execution and recovered through replay or checkpoints.

## Comparison Guides

All four systems below use the **implicit graph** approach - they're similar to each other and different from pgflow's explicit graph model.

## Key Differences

When comparing pgflow to other workflow systems, these are the most important architectural differences:

<Card title="🗄️ Database-Centric Orchestration">
  pgflow puts PostgreSQL at the center, using it not just for storage but for orchestration logic
</Card>

<Card title="⚡ Supabase Integration">
  Built specifically for the Supabase ecosystem with zero additional infrastructure
</Card>

<Card title="🔗 Explicit Data Dependencies">
  Flow steps connect through explicit data dependencies rather than procedural control flow
</Card>

<Card title="💾 PostgreSQL State Storage">
  All workflow state remains directly queryable in your Supabase database
</Card>

These guides help you decide which tool is best for your specific use case based on your requirements, preferences, and existing infrastructure.
