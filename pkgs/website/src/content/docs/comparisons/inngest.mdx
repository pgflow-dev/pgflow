## Features

| Feature | pgflow | Inngest |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Core Philosophy** | üîç Database as orchestrator | üîç Durable execution engine |
| **Infrastructure** | Zero additional (just Supabase) | Hosted service or self-hosted |
| **Workflow Definition** | TypeScript DSL with explicit dependencies | Step-based functions with checkpoints |
| **Supabase Integration** | Native | ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible but not optimized |
| **Type Safety** | Complete end-to-end | Via standard TypeScript |
| **Retry & Recovery** | Automatic per step | Automatic per step |
| **Execution Model** | Database-driven DAG | Linear step-by-step with state persistence |
| **Step State** | Input/output data stored in database | Input/output memoized in execution service |
| **Wait/Sleep** | Not directly supported (use pgcron) | Built-in sleep and waitForEvent capabilities |
| **Production Readiness** | ‚ö†Ô∏è MVP/Early stage | Production-ready |
| **Dashboard** | None (SQL queries for visibility) | Comprehensive web dashboard |
| **Concurrency Control** | Simple per-flow limits | Advanced throttling and concurrency controls |
| **Event System** | No built-in event system | Rich event-driven architecture |

Both systems provide reliable task execution with proper retries and error handling. The key difference is who controls the workflow orchestration: the database (pgflow) or a durable execution engine (Inngest).

## When to Choose

### pgflow
- **Supabase-native solution** - You need workflow orchestration directly within your Supabase stack
- **Transparent state storage** - You want workflow state directly visible and queryable in your database
- **Parallel data processing** - Your workflows involve processing data with multiple parallel paths
- **Database-centric ecosystem** - Your system already centers around PostgreSQL operations
- **Explicit data dependencies** - Your processes have clear input/output relationships between steps
- **Migration-based deployments** - You prefer deploying workflow changes via database migrations
- **Minimal infrastructure** - You want to avoid adding services beyond your Supabase project

### Inngest
- **Event-driven systems** - You're building applications centered around events and reactions
- **Temporal workflows** - You need sequences that wait for time or external events before continuing
- **Sequential steps** - Your processes follow linear paths with checkpointing
- **UI visibility need** - You need a dedicated dashboard for monitoring workflow executions
- **Multi-environment deployment** - You need to run the same workflows across different platforms
- **Sleep/wait mechanics** - Your workflows pause for specific time periods or external triggers
- **Throttling requirements** - You need sophisticated rate limiting for external API calls

## Code Examples

### pgflow

pgflow puts **PostgreSQL at the center** of your workflow orchestration. Workflows are defined in TypeScript but **compiled to SQL migrations** with all orchestration logic running **directly in the database**. The database decides when tasks are ready to execute based on explicit dependencies.

```typescript
// In pgflow, the database orchestrates the workflow
new Flow<{ url: string }>({
  slug: 'analyze_website',
})
  .step(
    { slug: 'extract' },
    async (input) => /* extract data */
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'transform', dependsOn: ['extract'] },
    async (input) => /* transform using extract results */
  );
```

### Inngest

Inngest uses a **durable execution engine** to orchestrate workflows. Functions are defined as a series of steps, where each step is a checkpoint that can be retried independently. The execution engine tracks state and resumes execution from the last successful step.

```typescript
// In Inngest, steps define checkpoints within a function
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

export default inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "analyze-website" },
  { event: "app/website.analyze" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Each step is retried independently
    const extracted = await step.run("extract", async () => {
      return await extractData(event.data.url);
    });

    // State is automatically passed between steps
    const transformed = await step.run("transform", async () => {
      return await transformData(extracted);
    });

    // Return the final result
    return { data: transformed };
  }
);
```

## Similarities

Both systems provide reliable execution of workflow tasks:

- Both handle retries and error recovery
- Both track execution state and progress
- Both provide type safety
- Both can process steps asynchronously
- Both store the state of workflow executions

The difference is architectural:
- pgflow: PostgreSQL orchestrates when steps run based on dependencies
- Inngest: Execution engine orchestrates steps sequentially with state memoization

## Integration with Supabase

### pgflow
- **Native integration** - Built specifically for Supabase ecosystem
- **Zero infrastructure** - Uses Supabase Edge Functions and PostgreSQL
- **Simple setup** - Single command (`npx pgflow install`) sets up all required components
- **Direct database access** - All workflow state directly accessible in your Supabase database

### Inngest
- **Possible integration** - Can work with Supabase but not specifically designed for it
- **Additional infrastructure** - Requires either hosted service or self-hosted instance
- **Event bridging** - Requires connecting Supabase events to Inngest's event system
- **Separate state storage** - Workflow state stored outside your Supabase database
