Now that you've created your first flow, learn how to structure your code, iterate on your flows, and clean up during development.

## Writing Flows

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Organize flow code"
    href="/build/organize-flow-code/"
    description="Structure your flows and tasks for maintainability and reusability"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Configuration patterns"
    href="/build/configuration-patterns/"
    description="Common configuration patterns for different scenarios"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Create reusable tasks"
    href="/build/create-reusable-tasks/"
    description="Build composable task functions that can be shared across flows"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Process arrays in parallel"
    href="/build/process-arrays-in-parallel/"
    description="Process arrays of data in parallel using map steps"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Flow Management

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Version flows"
    href="/build/version-flows/"
    description="Create new flow versions when making structural changes"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Delete flows"
    href="/build/delete-flows/"
    description="Clean up test flows during development (never use in production)"
  />
</CardGrid>
