## Filtering Console Noise

The Supabase Edge Runtime can produce verbose output during local development. This is especially noticeable because pgflow sends HTTP requests every 1 second to respawn workers quickly. To get cleaner logs that focus on your worker output, pipe through grep:

```bash frame="none"
npx supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt 2>&1 | \
  grep -Pv 'serving the request with supabase/functions/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+-worker|^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T[\d:.]+Z\s*$'
```

This filters out:
- Request serving messages for worker functions
- Empty timestamp lines

:::note[Shell Alias]
Add this to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, then run `source ~/.bashrc` to reload:

```bash frame="none"
alias supabase-serve="npx supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt 2>&1 | grep -Pv 'serving the request with supabase/functions/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+-worker|^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T[\d:.]+Z\s*$'"
```

Then just run: `supabase-serve`

## Auto-Restart Behavior

During local development, pgflow automatically:
- Restarts workers when you change flow code
- Recompiles flows when the shape changes
- Keeps workers running via cron (every 1 second)

See [Worker Lifecycle](/concepts/worker-lifecycle/) for details on how this works.

## Initial Worker Registration

The first time you start a worker, you need to trigger it once:

```bash frame="none"
curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/my-worker
```

After this initial registration, pgflow's cron keeps the worker running automatically.
