## Why pgflow > cron jobs and background tasks 🤯

#### Postgres‑Native & Supabase‑Integrated
Workflows run in Edge Functions, managed by Postgres and Supabase Queues.

#### Zero External Infrastructure
No extra servers or platforms to manage - everything self contained within Supabase.

#### Reliable by design
Structured retries, error handling, and detailed logs for every execution.

#### Structured Workflow (DAG & Scheduling)
Multi-step workflows with dependencies and scheduling.

#### Fast, One-Line CLI Setup
Simple one-command installation (`npx pgflow install`).

---

## How it works

1. **Create your flow** in a simple TypeScript DSL with full autocomplete.
2. **Deploy it** via simple to use CLI
3. **Trigger your flow** from database trigger, SQL function, REST API or frontend client
4. **Stream workflow progress** in browser with full visibility into steps and their results (coming soon!)

## Install & run in 5 minutes 🚀

```typescript
// setup it once for project
npx pgflow install

// generate a new flow
npx pgflow create

// deploy a flow worker locally or on production
npx pgflow deploy
```

## FAQ - Supabase Workflows and Background jobs

#### Q: How is pgflow different from Supabase cron?

A: pgflow adds retries, concurrency control & observability that cron lacks—plus multi‑step DAGs.

#### Q: Can I run pgflow on Supabase Edge?

A: Yes. The worker ships as a Deno function that deploys with supabase functions deploy.

#### Q: Does pgflow handle AI agent workflows?
A: Absolutely. Chain LLM calls or vector ops as steps; pgflow persists state so nothing is lost on timeouts.
