import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## How it works

1. **Create your flow** in a simple TypeScript DSL with full autocomplete.
2. **Deploy it** via simple to use CLI
3. **Trigger your flow** from database trigger, SQL function, REST API or frontend client
4. **Stream workflow progress** in browser with full visibility into steps and their results (coming soon!)

## Install & run in 5 minutes ðŸš€

<Steps>

1. Install pgflow

    ```typescript
    npx pgflow install
    ```

2. Create your first flow

    ```typescript
    npx pgflow create
    ```

3. Deploy your flow locally

    ```bash
    npx pgflow deploy
    ```

4. Trigger your flow

    ```typescript
    import { createPgflowClient } from '@pgflow/client';
    import { AnalyzeWebsiteFlow } from './flows/analyze-website';

    const pgflow = createPgflowClient({ supabase });

    const flowRun = pgflow.startFlow(AnalyzeWebsiteFlow, { url: 'https://supabase.com' });
    ```

5. Monitor your flow

    #### Wait for a step to complete and use its output

    ```typescript
    const websiteContent = await flowRun.waitForStep('fetch-website');
    ```

    #### React to step events

    ```typescript
    flowRun.on('completed', (step) => { 
      console.log(step.slug);
      console.log(step.output);
    });
    ```

    #### React to failures

    ```typescript
    try {
      await flowRun
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error.data);
    }

    flowRun.on('failed', (step) => { 
      console.log(step.slug);
      console.log(step.error);
    });
    ```
</Steps>

## FAQ - Supabase Workflows and Background jobs

#### Q: How is pgflow different from Supabase cron?

A: pgflow adds retries, concurrency control & observability that cron lacksâ€”plus multiâ€‘step DAGs.

#### Q: Can I run pgflow on Supabase Edge?

A: Yes. The worker ships as a Deno function that deploys with supabase functions deploy.

#### Q: Does pgflow handle AI agent workflows?
A: Absolutely. Chain LLM calls or vector ops as steps; pgflow persists state so nothing is lost on timeouts.
