## How it works

1. **Create your flow** in a simple TypeScript DSL with full autocomplete.
2. **Deploy it** via simple to use CLI
3. **Trigger your flow** from database trigger, SQL function, REST API or frontend client
4. **Stream workflow progress** in browser with full visibility into steps and their results (coming soon!)

## Install & run in 5 minutes ðŸš€

```typescript
// setup it once for project
npx pgflow install

// generate a new flow
npx pgflow create

// deploy a flow worker locally or on production
npx pgflow deploy
```

## FAQ - Supabase Workflows and Background jobs

#### Q: How is pgflow different from Supabase cron?

A: pgflow adds retries, concurrency control & observability that cron lacksâ€”plus multiâ€‘step DAGs.

#### Q: Can I run pgflow on Supabase Edge?

A: Yes. The worker ships as a Deno function that deploys with supabase functions deploy.

#### Q: Does pgflow handle AI agent workflows?
A: Absolutely. Chain LLM calls or vector ops as steps; pgflow persists state so nothing is lost on timeouts.
