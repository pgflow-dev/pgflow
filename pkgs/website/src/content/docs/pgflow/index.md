**pgflow** is a Postgres-first workflow engine I began building in November. I wanted a **deeply integrated**, open-source solution that **runs entirely on Supabase—no external workers or self-hosting required**. Since I couldn’t find one, I decided to build it.

##### Can I use it?

**Not yet** - I've released [Edge Worker](/edge-worker/how-it-works) first and the flow engine will follow
after gathering some feedback and improving the worker.

I'm aiming to have the alpha version and docs ready in Q1 2025 (soft deadline :-)).

##### Have questions or want to say Hi?
