## Logging

Edge Worker automatically configures logging based on your environment:
- **Local development**: Colorful "fancy" format at `verbose` level
- **Hosted Supabase**: Structured key=value format at `info` level

You can override the log level by setting `EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL`:

```bash
# supabase/functions/.env
EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Available log levels (from least to most verbose):

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `error` | Critical failures only |
| `warn` | Deprecation notices, auth failures |
| `info` | Startup banner, shutdown events |
| `verbose` | Task outcomes, polling feedback |
| `debug` | Task started events, detailed identifiers |

For complete logging configuration including output format options and examples, see [Worker Logging Configuration](/reference/configuration/worker/#logging-configuration).

## Heartbeats

Edge Worker sends heartbeats every 5 seconds and updates `last_heartbeat_at` column in `pgflow.workers` table.

### List of active workers

In order to get a list of active workers, we need to fetch those that have pinged in the last 6 seconds (+1s to account for delays):

```sql frame="none"
SELECT *
FROM pgflow.workers
WHERE last_heartbeat_at > now() - make_interval(secs => 6)
```
