This guide walks you through deploying pgflow workers to Supabase.com. Workers run as Edge Functions that poll for tasks, execute your flow handlers, and report results back to the database.

Before starting, ensure you have completed [Getting Started](/get-started/installation/) and have a Supabase project linked to your local environment.

## Deployment Overview

<Steps>
1. ### Get Connection String

   Retrieve the Transaction pooler connection string from your Supabase dashboard. Workers use this to connect to your hosted database securely.

2. ### Configure Secrets

   Set up vault secrets so pgflow can automatically manage and restart your workers in production.

3. ### Deploy First Flow

   Store the connection string as a secret, deploy your worker Edge Function, and register it with pgflow.
