This page explains the main components of pgflow and their current development status.

It also outlines future features that have been planned or prototyped.

## MVP Features

These are the core components that make up the current pgflow system.

<Card title="SQL Engine" icon="star">
  The SQL Core is a database-based workflow engine that manages state transitions for directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflows, providing functions to define, start, and track work through a PostgreSQL-native state machine.

  ##### Status: ‚úÖ Working / Needs polish

  Well tested and works, small chores to be done (cleaning migrations, adding indexes etc)
</Card>

<Card title="TypeScript DSL" icon="seti:typescript">
  The TypeScript DSL is a strongly-typed, fluent API for defining PostgreSQL-native workflows that automatically infers input and output types through the dependency graph, providing type safety and autocompletion without requiring manual type annotations beyond the initial flow input.

  ##### Status: ‚úÖ Working / Production ready

  Well tested and usable
</Card>

<Card title="Edge Worker" icon="rocket">
  The Edge Worker is a specialized task queue worker designed for serverless environments that retrieves tasks from a database queue, executes them, and acknowledges their completion or failure, serving as the execution engine that processes the workflow steps defined in the SQL Core.

  ##### Status: ‚úÖ Working / Needs polish

  Tested and usable, need option validation and more integration tests
</Card>

<Card title="CLI" icon="seti:powershell">
  The pgflow CLI is a command-line interface that facilitates the installation, configuration, and usage of the pgflow workflow engine. It's a critical component for the initial setup experience, providing tools for database migrations, Supabase project configuration, and compiling TypeScript workflow definitions into SQL.

  ##### Status: üöß Usable / Needs improvement

  Core functionality exists, but the developer experience has significant gaps. The current setup is brittle as it requires the Deno binary to be installed.

  **Short-term plan:** Improve setup UX or provide CLI-less installation instructions for users who prefer manual setup.
</Card>

## MVP Completion Criteria

For pgflow to be considered at MVP status, the following criteria must be met:

- ‚úÖ **SQL Engine:** Stable, documented, and reliable for production use
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript DSL:** Working correctly, generating proper SQL
- ‚úÖ **Edge Worker:** Running workflows reliably in production environments
- ‚è≥ **CLI or documented manual setup:** Providing a smooth onboarding experience
- ‚è≥ **End-to-end example:** At least one complete example that demonstrates the full workflow

## Roadmap

These roadmap items are exploratory and not committed to any timeline. We're validating demand before prioritizing implementation.

<Card title="Client Library" icon="setting">
  <div style="background-color: var(--sl-color-gray-6); padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <strong>Tag: Spiked ‚úÖ</strong>
  </div>
  
  Planned client library aims to support streaming step outputs using Supabase Realtime. This could unlock real-time agent interfaces and faster feedback loops.

  <Aside type="note">
    Spiked to verify the concept, have concrete implementation plan
  </Aside>
</Card>

<Card title="Conditional Execution" icon="random">
  <div style="background-color: var(--sl-color-gray-6); padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <strong>Tag: Spiked ‚úÖ</strong>
  </div>
  
  The Condition feature will allow skipping parts of workflow execution by matching input parameters to a JSON object defined in the DSL, enabling conditional execution based on runtime data. This powerful capability will enable more dynamic workflows that can adapt to various conditions and branch logic.

<Card title="Branching / Inlined Subflows" icon="right-arrow">
  <div style="background-color: var(--sl-color-gray-6); padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <strong>Tag: Spiked ‚úÖ</strong>
  </div>
  
  Branching will be an extension to DSL that will encapsulate a set of steps in a separate "branch" with its own name, condition, retry logic, inputs and outputs, but will just inline the steps under the hood. Extremely useful when combined with conditional execution feature.

  <Aside type="note">
    Spiked a simple implementation, have concrete implementation plan
  </Aside>
</Card>

<Card title="Fanout Steps" icon="open-book">
  <div style="background-color: var(--sl-color-gray-6); padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <strong>Tag: Planned üìù</strong>
  </div>
  
  Fanout steps will allow to depend on an input array and will queue a separate task for each element in the array for parallel processing. The outputs from the tasks will get merged into a single output array in the order of the input array. Allows do dynamically process things in parallel.

  <Aside type="note">
    No code spiked yet but have a good plan on how to implement it and system have already some contraptions in place (task_index in step_states table).
  </Aside>
</Card>

<Card title="Subruns (Real Subflows)" icon="puzzle">
  <div style="background-color: var(--sl-color-gray-6); padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 4px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <strong>Tag: Concept üöß</strong>
  </div>
  
  This will allow users to use an existing flow as a single step in another flow, and the runs will be separate (will involve keeping relationship between parent and child runs).

  <Aside type="note">
    No spike yet, but rather concrete implementation plan
  </Aside>
