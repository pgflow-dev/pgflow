pgflow's configuration is divided into two distinct parts, each serving a different purpose in the workflow lifecycle.

pgflow separates configuration into **task execution** settings (how individual steps are executed and retried) and **worker** settings (how the worker processes the entire flow). Task settings are stored in your database and control retry behavior, delays, and timeouts, while worker settings control concurrency, connections, and batching.

<Aside title="Zero Configuration" type="tip">
pgflow comes with sensible defaults for all configuration options.

You only need to specify slugs for your flow and steps:

```ts
new Flow({ slug: 'my_flow' })
  .step({ slug: 'step1' }, handler1)
  .step({ slug: 'step2' }, handler2)
```
