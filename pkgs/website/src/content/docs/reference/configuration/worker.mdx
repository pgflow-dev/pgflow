These settings control how the Edge Worker processes tasks from your flows. They're passed when starting the worker and affect performance and resource utilization.

<Aside type="note">
Worker configuration requires redeploying your Edge Function to change, while flow/step configuration can be updated on the fly with SQL queries. See [Tune Deployed Flows](/deploy/tune-flow-config/) for details on updating configuration without redeployment.

## Default Worker Configuration

When using pgflow with Edge Worker, configure the worker's behavior:

```typescript
import { EdgeWorker } from '@pgflow/edge-worker';
import MyFlow from './flows/my_flow.ts';

EdgeWorker.start(MyFlow, {
  // Worker concurrency settings
  maxConcurrent: 10,      // Process up to 10 tasks simultaneously
  maxPgConnections: 4,    // Database connection pool size

  // Polling configuration
  batchSize: 10,          // Fetch up to 10 tasks per poll
  maxPollSeconds: 2,      // Long-poll duration
  pollIntervalMs: 100,    // Database polling frequency
});
```

## `maxConcurrent`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `10`

Maximum number of tasks that can be processed simultaneously. Increase for I/O-heavy tasks, decrease for CPU-heavy tasks.

## `maxPgConnections`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `4`

Size of the PostgreSQL connection pool. Should generally be less than `maxConcurrent` since not all tasks need a connection at all times.

## `batchSize`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `10`

Maximum number of tasks to fetch in a single poll operation. Larger batches are more efficient but may lead to uneven work distribution.

## `maxPollSeconds`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `2`

How long to wait for tasks during each poll cycle. Shorter durations ensure more responsive task pickup.

<Aside type="caution">
Keep `maxPollSeconds` below the heartbeat interval (5 seconds) for flow workers to ensure proper heartbeat timing.
</Aside>

## `pollIntervalMs`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `100`

How frequently (in milliseconds) to check the database for new tasks during the poll cycle.

## Accessing Worker Configuration in Handlers

Your flow step handlers can access the resolved worker configuration through the context object. For detailed information about available configuration options and usage patterns, see [`workerConfig`](/reference/context/#workerconfig).

## Background Jobs Mode Differences

When using Edge Worker in [Background Jobs Mode](/get-started/faq/#what-are-the-two-edge-worker-modes) (without pgflow orchestration), there are a few key differences:

- **No flow/step configuration**: Queue workers don't have `maxAttempts`, `baseDelay`, `timeout`, or `startDelay` options in the flow definition. Instead, these are configured directly in the worker options.
- **`queueName` option**: Queue workers can specify a custom queue name (default is `tasks`), while flow workers automatically use the flow slug as the queue name.
- **Handler signature**: Queue workers receive a simple payload, while flow workers receive a context object with `input`, `run`, and previous step outputs.

For complete queue worker configuration, see [Queue Worker Configuration](/reference/queue-worker/configuration/).
