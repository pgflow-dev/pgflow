You can pass an optional configuration object as the second argument to `EdgeWorker.start()`
to tweak the worker's behavior.

<Aside title="Zero Configuration" type="tip">
Edge Worker comes with sensible defaults for all configuration options.

You only need to provide a handler function:

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(console.log);
```
</Aside>

:::caution[Configuration Validation]
Currently, configuration options are not validated at runtime. Please double-check your settings carefully.
:::


### Default configuration

```typescript
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  // name of the queue to poll for messages
  queueName: 'tasks',

  // how many tasks are processed at the same time
  maxConcurrent: 10,

  // how many connections to the database are opened
  maxPgConnections: 4,

  // in-worker polling interval
  maxPollSeconds: 5,

  // in-database polling interval
  pollIntervalMs: 200,

  // retry configuration for failed messages
  retry: {
    strategy: 'exponential', // exponential backoff (default)
    limit: 5,               // max retry attempts
    baseDelay: 3,           // initial delay in seconds
    maxDelay: 300,          // max delay cap in seconds
  },

  // how long a job is invisible after reading
  // if not successful, will reappear after this time
  visibilityTimeout: 10,
});
```

## Queue configuration

:::tip[You don't need to create queues manually]
The worker will automatically create a logged, non-partitioned queue
with configured name during startup if it does not exist.
:::

### `queueName`
**Type:** `string`
**Default:** `'tasks'`

The name of the PGMQ queue to listen to for messages.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  queueName: 'my_custom_queue'
});
```

## Message Processing

### `visibilityTimeout`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `10`

The duration (in seconds) that a message remains invisible to other consumers while being processed.

<Aside title="Message Visibility and Processing" type="caution">
Keep `visibilityTimeout` higher than your task's maximum processing time.
  <details>
  <summary>
  Here's why:
  </summary>
  - When a worker picks up a message, it becomes invisible for `visibilityTimeout` seconds
  - If processing takes longer than `visibilityTimeout`, the message becomes visible again
  - Other workers can then pick up and process the same message
  - This leads to duplicate processing of the same task
  - For example: with `visibilityTimeout: 3` and a task that takes 5 seconds, the message could be processed twice
  </details>
</Aside>

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  visibilityTimeout: 5 // message will re-appear in queue after 5 seconds if not processed
});
```

### `maxConcurrent`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `10`

This option limits concurrency - the maximum number of messages that can be processed at the same time.
Increase for IO-heavy tasks (network or db calls), decrease for CPU-heavy tasks.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  maxConcurrent: 10 // Process up to 10 messages at once
});
```

### `maxPgConnections`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `4`

Maximum number of concurrent database connections.
Increase for IO-heavy tasks (network or database operations), decrease for CPU-heavy tasks.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  maxPgConnections: 10 // Use up to 10 connections to the database
});
```

## Polling Behavior

### `maxPollSeconds`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `5`

Amount of seconds to wait for a message to be available in the queue.

:::caution[Polling and Worker Health]
Keep `maxPollSeconds` at 5 seconds or lower.
  <details>
  <summary>
  Here's why:
  </summary>
  - Heartbeats are sent once per main loop iteration
  - Each iteration can take up to `maxPollSeconds` to complete
  - Workers are considered inactive after 6 seconds without a heartbeat
  - Therefore, `maxPollSeconds` must be lower than 5 seconds to account for any additional delays
  </details>
:::

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  maxPollSeconds: 5 // Long-poll for 5 seconds waiting for a message
});
```

### `pollIntervalMs`
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `200`

The interval (in milliseconds) between database polling attempts by `pgmq.read_with_poll`.
The default value is suitable for most use cases.

<Aside type="caution" title="Polling Intervals">
Keep `pollIntervalMs` lower than `maxPollSeconds * 1000`.
  <details>
  <summary>
  Here's why:
  </summary>
  - The worker polls the database every `pollIntervalMs` milliseconds
  - This polling continues until `maxPollSeconds` is reached
  - If `pollIntervalMs` is too high, the worker might exit after just one poll
  - For example: with `maxPollSeconds: 5` and `pollIntervalMs: 6000`, only one poll would occur
  </details>
</Aside>


```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  pollIntervalMs: 300 // Poll every 300ms
});
```

## Retries

### `retry`
**Type:** `RetryConfig`
**Default:** `{ strategy: 'exponential', limit: 5, baseDelay: 3, maxDelay: 300 }`

Configures how failed messages are retried. Edge Worker supports two retry strategies:

- **`exponential`** (default): Delay doubles with each retry attempt
- **`fixed`**: Constant delay between all retry attempts

#### Retry Delay Comparison

Here's how retry delays differ between strategies with the same base delay:

| Attempt | Fixed (baseDelay: 5s) | Exponential (baseDelay: 5s) | Exponential (baseDelay: 5s, maxDelay: 60s) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1       | 5s                   | 5s                           | 5s                                          |
| 2       | 5s                   | 10s                          | 10s                                         |
| 3       | 5s                   | 20s                          | 20s                                         |
| 4       | 5s                   | 40s                          | 40s                                         |
| 5       | 5s                   | 80s                          | 60s (capped)                                |
| 6       | 5s                   | 160s                         | 60s (capped)                                |
| 7       | 5s                   | 320s                         | 60s (capped)                                |
| 8       | 5s                   | 640s                         | 60s (capped)                                |

#### Exponential Backoff Strategy

**Type:**
```typescript
interface ExponentialRetryConfig {
  strategy: 'exponential';
  limit: number;      // Max retry attempts
  baseDelay: number;  // Initial delay in seconds
  maxDelay?: number;  // Maximum delay cap in seconds (default: 300)
}
```

With exponential backoff, the delay between retries increases exponentially: `baseDelay * 2^(attempt-1)`. For example, with `baseDelay: 3`, the delays would be 3s, 6s, 12s, 24s, etc.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retry: {
    strategy: 'exponential',
    limit: 5,        // max 5 retry attempts
    baseDelay: 2,    // start with 2 second delay
    maxDelay: 60,    // cap delays at 60 seconds
  }
});
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Exponential Backoff Benefits">
Exponential backoff is the default strategy because it:
- Reduces load on failing services by spacing out retries
- Gives transient errors more time to resolve
- Prevents thundering herd problems during outages

This strategy provides better resilience and system stability compared to fixed delays.
</Aside>

#### Fixed Delay Strategy

**Type:**
```typescript
interface FixedRetryConfig {
  strategy: 'fixed';
  limit: number;      // Max retry attempts
  baseDelay: number;  // Constant delay between retries in seconds
}
```

With fixed delay, the time between retries remains constant regardless of the attempt number.

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retry: {
    strategy: 'fixed',
    limit: 3,        // max 3 retry attempts
    baseDelay: 10,   // always wait 10 seconds between retries
  }
});
```

#### Disabling Retries

To disable retries entirely, set `limit` to 0:

```ts
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retry: {
    strategy: 'fixed',  // Strategy doesn't matter when limit is 0
    limit: 0,           // no retries
    baseDelay: 0,
  }
});
```

### `retryDelay` <Badge text="deprecated" variant="caution" />
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `5`

:::caution[Deprecated]
`retryDelay` is deprecated. Use the new `retry` configuration with `strategy: 'fixed'` instead:

```ts
// Old (deprecated)
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retryDelay: 5,
  retryLimit: 3,
});

// New (recommended)
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retry: {
    strategy: 'fixed',
    limit: 3,
    baseDelay: 5,
  }
});
```

See the [retry configuration](#retry) section above for details.
:::

Number of seconds to wait between retry attempts when using a fixed delay strategy.

### `retryLimit` <Badge text="deprecated" variant="caution" />
**Type:** `number`
**Default:** `5`

:::caution[Deprecated]
`retryLimit` is deprecated. Use the new `retry.limit` configuration instead:

```ts
// Old (deprecated)
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retryLimit: 5,
});

// New (recommended)
EdgeWorker.start(handler, {
  retry: {
    strategy: 'exponential',
    limit: 5,
    baseDelay: 3,
  }
});
```

See the [retry configuration](#retry) section above for details.
:::

Maximum number of retry attempts for failed message processing before marking the message as dead.

## Accessing Configuration in Handlers

Your handler functions can access the resolved worker configuration through the context object. For detailed information about available configuration options and usage patterns, see [`workerConfig`](/reference/context/#workerconfig).

## Logging Configuration

Edge Worker automatically configures logging based on your environment. For local development, it uses colorful "fancy" output at verbose level. For hosted Supabase, it uses structured key=value output at info level.

You can override these defaults with environment variables:

| Variable | Values | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL` | `error`, `warn`, `info`, `verbose`, `debug` | `verbose` (local), `info` (hosted) |
| `EDGE_WORKER_LOG_FORMAT` | `fancy`, `simple` | Auto-detected |
| `NO_COLOR` | Any value | Unset |

For detailed information about log levels, output formats, and examples, see [Worker Logging Configuration](/reference/configuration/worker/#logging-configuration).
