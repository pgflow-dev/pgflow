pgflow's TypeScript Domain Specific Language (DSL) is designed to create type-safe, data-driven workflows. This guide explains how the DSL works and the principles behind its design.

## The Flow DSL Philosophy

The Flow DSL is built on several key principles:

1. **Type Safety** - Complete type checking from flow inputs to outputs
2. **Functional Approach** - Composable functions with clear inputs and outputs
3. **Separation of Concerns** - Task logic separate from flow orchestration
4. **Fluent Interface** - Chainable method calls that return new Flow instances

### Fluent API Design

The pgflow DSL uses a fluent interface where each `.step()` call returns a new Flow instance:

```typescript
// Each .step() returns a new Flow instance
const flow1 = new Flow<Input>({ slug: 'my_flow' });
const flow2 = flow1.step({ slug: 'step1' }, async (input) => { /* ... */ });
const flow3 = flow2.step({ slug: 'step2' }, async (input) => { /* ... */ });

// In practice, you'll typically use method chaining
new Flow<Input>({ slug: 'my_flow' })
  .step({ slug: 'step1' }, async (input) => { /* ... */ })
  .step({ slug: 'step2' }, async (input) => { /* ... */ });
```

Important characteristics of this fluent design:

- **Immutable Flow Objects** - Each `.step()` call creates a new Flow instance without modifying the original
- **Required Method Chaining** - Steps must be added by chaining `.step()` calls
- **Declarative Definition** - The entire flow is defined in a single declarative expression
- **No Side Effects** - Adding steps doesn't modify any internal state of existing Flow instances

This approach ensures that flow definitions are predictable, testable, and immune to side effects.

## Understanding Step Inputs and Data Flow

### The `input` Object: A Unified View of Data

In pgflow, **every step receives a unified `input` object** with two critical parts:

1. **`input.run`** - The original flow input, available to ALL steps
2. **`input.{stepName}`** - Outputs from any dependency steps

:::important[The input.run Field]
Every step in your flow, regardless of its position or dependencies, has access to the complete flow input via `input.run`. This is a fundamental design feature that ensures:

- All steps can access original flow parameters
- Global context is available throughout the flow
- Steps can make decisions based on the initial input
- Data doesn't need to be passed through intermediate steps
:::

Consider this simple example:

```typescript
new Flow<{ url: string, userId: string }>({  // Define flow input type
  slug: 'analyze_website',
})
  .step(
    { slug: 'scrape' },
    async (input) => {
      console.log(`Scraping URL ${input.run.url} for user ${input.run.userId}`);
      return await scrapeWebsite(input.run.url);
    }
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'analyze', dependsOn: ['scrape'] },
    async (input) => {
      console.log(`Analyzing content for user ${input.run.userId}`);  // Still has access to userId
      return await analyzeContent(input.scrape.content);
    }
  );
```

### How Data Flows Through Steps

Here's the data flow sequence:

1. The flow receives an input object (e.g., `{ url: "example.com", userId: "123" }`)
2. The `scrape` step:
   - Receives the complete flow input as `input.run` (containing both url and userId)
   - Calls `scrapeWebsite()` with the URL
   - Returns an object (with a `content` property)
3. The `analyze` step:
   - Receives the same complete flow input as `input.run` (identical to what scrape received)
   - ALSO receives the `scrape` step's output as `input.scrape`
   - Can use both the original input AND the previous step's output
   - Calls `analyzeContent()` with the content
   - Returns the analysis results

This unified input structure means:
- Original flow parameters are never lost, no matter how deep in the flow
- Steps don't need to manually forward parameters to downstream steps
- Dependent steps can combine original input with processed data

## The Type System and `input.run`

One of pgflow's most powerful features is its type system, which ensures type safety across the entire workflow, especially with the critical `input.run` field:

```typescript
// Define input type for the flow
type WebsiteInput = { url: string, userId: string };

// Create a flow with that input type and chain steps
new Flow<WebsiteInput>({
  slug: 'analyze_website',
})
  // TypeScript knows the shape of input.run
  .step(
    { slug: 'scrape' },
    async (input) => {
      // input.run is typed as WebsiteInput
      // input.run.url and input.run.userId are available
      return { content: "..." };
    }
  )
  // TypeScript knows the shape of dependency outputs
  .step(
    { slug: 'analyze', dependsOn: ['scrape'] },
    async (input) => {
      // input.scrape is typed based on the scrape step's return type
      // input.scrape.content is available
      return { analysis: "..." };
    }
  );
```

The type system automatically:
- Ensures the flow receives the correct input type
- Makes the flow input type available as `input.run` in **every** step
- Tracks the output type of each step
- Makes those output types available to dependent steps via `input.[stepName]`
- Provides IDE autocompletion for all available properties
- Catches type errors at compile time

:::tip[Type System in Action]
Note how TypeScript provides full autocompletion for both `input.run` properties and dependency outputs. This allows you to confidently access any available data without runtime errors.
:::

## Task Implementation Best Practices

The Flow DSL encourages a functional programming approach to tasks:

```typescript
// RECOMMENDED: Pure function with clear inputs and outputs
async function analyzeContent(content: string) {
  // Process the content
  return { sentiment: 0.8, topics: ["technology", "data"] };
}

// In the flow:
.step(
  { slug: 'analyze', dependsOn: ['scrape'] },
  async (input) => await analyzeContent(input.scrape.content)
);
```

This approach:
- Makes tasks reusable across different flows
- Keeps task logic separate from flow orchestration
- Simplifies testing of individual tasks
- Allows tasks to evolve independently of the flow structure

:::note[Best Practice]
A well-designed task function should:
- Accept specific, focused parameters
- Return a well-defined output structure
- Have no knowledge of the flow or other steps
- Be testable in isolation
:::

## How Steps Connect and Execute

Steps are connected through explicit dependencies:

```typescript
.step(
  { slug: 'summary', dependsOn: ['website'] },
  // Function implementation...
)
```

When a flow runs:

1. pgflow identifies steps with no dependencies ("root steps") and runs them first
2. As steps complete, any dependent steps whose dependencies are all satisfied become eligible to run
3. Steps with the same dependencies can run in parallel
4. The flow completes when all steps have completed or failed

This execution model:
- Maximizes parallelism when possible
- Ensures proper ordering of dependent operations
- Handles retries and failures automatically

## The Flow Definition vs. Execution

It's important to understand the distinction between flow definition and execution:

1. **Definition** (TypeScript): The flow structure defined using the DSL
2. **Compilation**: Conversion of the TypeScript flow to SQL
3. **Registration**: Storage of the flow structure in the database
4. **Execution**: The runtime system that processes tasks based on the database definition

The TypeScript DSL is used only for definition and compilation - it's not involved in the actual execution of workflows. This separation allows:
- Versioning and tracking of flow definitions
- Consistent execution regardless of client language
- Persistence of workflow state in the database

## Example: Data Transformation Flow with `input.run`

Let's see a more comprehensive example showing how `input.run` enables data to flow efficiently through steps:

```typescript
// Flow with multiple input parameters
new Flow<{ userId: string, includeDetails: boolean, reportType: 'basic' | 'advanced' }>({
  slug: 'user_report',
})
  // Step 1: Fetch user data
  .step(
    { slug: 'user' },
    async (input) => {
      // Uses input.run.userId directly
      return await fetchUser(input.run.userId);
    }
  )
  // Steps 2 & 3: Process user data in parallel, both using input.run parameters
  .step(
    { slug: 'activity', dependsOn: ['user'] },
    async (input) => {
      // Can access both input.run and input.user
      const activityTimespan = input.run.reportType === 'advanced' ? '1y' : '30d';
      return await getUserActivity(input.user.id, activityTimespan);
    }
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'preferences', dependsOn: ['user'] },
    async (input) => {
      // Uses input.run.includeDetails to determine level of detail
      const includePrivate = input.run.includeDetails;
      return await getUserPreferences(input.user.id, includePrivate);
    }
  )
  // Step 4: Combine results, still having access to original input parameters
  .step(
    { slug: 'report', dependsOn: ['activity', 'preferences'] },
    async (input) => {
      // Can still access ALL original parameters alongside ALL previous step outputs
      return {
        user: input.user,
        activity: input.activity,
        preferences: input.preferences,
        reportType: input.run.reportType,  // Original parameter still available
        generatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
      };
    }
  );
```

This example demonstrates the power of the `input.run` field:

1. **Initial parameters are available everywhere** - Every step can access `userId`, `includeDetails`, and `reportType`
2. **Conditional processing based on input** - Steps can adapt behavior based on original parameters:
   - `activity` step chooses timespan based on report type 
   - `preferences` step determines detail level from includeDetails flag
3. **No need to manually forward parameters** - The `user` step doesn't need to include the original parameters in its return value
4. **Complete context in final step** - The `report` step can access everything: original inputs and all processed data
5. **Type safety throughout** - TypeScript ensures all accesses are valid

## Summary

The pgflow DSL provides a powerful, type-safe way to define complex workflows:

- It provides the original flow input via `input.run` to every step in the workflow
- It uses TypeScript's type system to ensure data flows correctly between steps
- It encourages a functional approach with clear inputs and outputs
- It separates task implementation from flow orchestration
- It allows for parallel execution of independent steps
- It automatically manages dependencies between steps

### Key Takeaways About `input.run`

- **Universal Availability**: Every step receives `input.run` containing the complete flow input
- **Parameter Persistence**: Original parameters are available throughout the entire workflow
- **No Manual Forwarding**: No need to pass input parameters through intermediate steps
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures all accesses to `input.run` are type-checked
- **Simplified Code**: Steps can focus on their specific tasks rather than parameter management

By understanding these principles, especially the role of `input.run`, you can design efficient, maintainable workflows that take full advantage of pgflow's capabilities.
