## Public Beta

pgflow is in **public beta** and being used in production by early adopters. Core functionality is stable and reliable.

## Known Limitations & Active Work

<Card title="Performance" icon="rocket">
  Core operations are optimized with batching, proper indexing, and declarative SQL. However, **large-scale workloads** may reveal additional optimization opportunities. Start with your expected workload and scale as needed.
</Card>

<Card title="Worker Management" icon="setting">
  Edge Functions have platform execution time limits. For production reliability, set up a **pg_cron job** to automatically restart workers when needed. See [deployment guide](/deploy/supabase/keep-workers-running/) for the simple 2-minute setup.
</Card>

<Card title="Fair Processing" icon="warning">
  Fair processing across flows is not currently implemented. A flow with many tasks (especially map steps processing large arrays) can fill the queue ahead of other flows. This is more noticeable with the introduction of map steps in 0.7.0. For multi-tenant or multi-flow scenarios where fairness is important, join [Discord](https://pgflow.dev/discord/) to discuss approaches and workarounds.
</Card>

<Card title="Permissions" icon="approve-check">
  pgflow ships with zero built-in permissions or access controls. [Database permissions](/reference/permissions/) must be manually configured when using the TypeScript Client or Supabase RPC from client applications. In a future release, pgflow will support custom start functions for the TypeScript Client, enabling authorization logic at the database level and supporting multi-tenant scenarios.
</Card>

## Breaking Changes

During beta, breaking changes may be introduced for critical fixes or significant improvements. All changes are documented in [release notes](https://github.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/releases) with migration guides. See [updating pgflow](/deploy/update-pgflow/) for the update process.

## Production Recommendations

<Aside type="tip">
- Test thoroughly for your specific use case before going to production
- Monitor workflow execution and worker health continuously
- Start with moderate workloads and scale as you verify performance
- Set up the worker safety net for reliable production operation
- Have backup strategies for critical workflows and data
- Join our community for support and to share experiences
