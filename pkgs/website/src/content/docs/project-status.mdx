## Public Beta

pgflow is in **public beta** and being used in production by early adopters. Core functionality is stable and reliable.

## Known Limitations & Active Work

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="rocket">
    Core operations are optimized with batching, proper indexing, and declarative SQL. However, **large-scale workloads** may reveal additional optimization opportunities. Start with your expected workload and scale as needed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Developer Experience" icon="pencil">
    Flow compilation is currently manual (`pgflow compile`). **Auto-compilation in workers** is in development to streamline the workflow and eliminate this step.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Worker Management" icon="setting">
    Edge Functions have platform execution time limits. For production reliability, set up a **pg_cron job** to automatically restart workers when needed. See [deployment guide](/deploy/supabase/keep-workers-running/) for the simple 2-minute setup.

## Production Recommendations

<Aside type="tip">
- Test thoroughly for your specific use case before going to production
- Monitor workflow execution and worker health continuously
- Start with moderate workloads and scale as you verify performance
- Set up the worker safety net for reliable production operation
- Have backup strategies for critical workflows and data
- Join our community for support and to share experiences
