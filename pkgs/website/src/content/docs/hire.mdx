## Hi, I'm Wojciech Majewski

I'm the creator of pgflow and a full-stack engineer with 18+ years of experience building scalable systems across different technologies and teams.

I specialize in PostgreSQL, Supabase, and helping teams add reliable durable execution to their applications. My technical leadership has helped startups achieve major milestones, including securing a $3.5M seed round.

**Technologies:** PostgreSQL • Supabase • TypeScript • React • Database-first architecture

## What I can help with

<CardGrid>
<Card title="Durable Execution" icon="puzzle">
Add fault-tolerant, resumable execution to your applications. Perfect for long-running processes, data pipelines, and complex multi-step business logic that needs to survive failures.
</Card>

<Card title="AI-powered Web Apps" icon="rocket">
Build intelligent applications with pgflow handling complex AI workflows - from RAG systems to multi-step LLM processing with proper error handling and retries.
</Card>

<Card title="Supabase Architecture" icon="seti:db">
Full-stack Supabase expertise: TypeScript workflows, Edge Functions, database-centric business logic, Realtime subscriptions, pg_cron scheduling, and background job systems.
</Card>

<Card title="PostgreSQL Expertise" icon="approve-check-circle">
Deep PostgreSQL knowledge: query optimization, index design, RLS security policies, schema migrations, and moving business logic into the database layer.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## How it works

<Steps>

1. ##### Start with a 15-minute intro call
2. ##### Goal: confirm fit and define the next step
3. ##### If useful, we schedule a deeper scoping session
