## What I can help with

- üöÄ **pgflow workflow orchestration** - Database-native workflows that enable RAG pipelines, multi-step LLM processing, and deterministic AI agent architectures
- üì° **Real-time streaming systems** - Build reactive applications that stream workflow progress in real-time with the pgflow client
- üèóÔ∏è **Modern Supabase architecture** - TypeScript workflows, Edge Functions, and database-native orchestration that scales
- üîí **Production-ready PostgreSQL** - Secure RLS policies, performance optimization, and schema design for modern applications  
- üë®‚Äçüè´ **Database-first development** - Mentoring teams to build reliable, observable systems using PostgreSQL-native patterns

## How it works

<Steps>

1. Start with a 15-minute fit check call
2. Goal: confirm fit and define the next step
3. If useful, we schedule a deeper scoping session

## Why pgflow Changes Everything

pgflow represents a breakthrough in workflow orchestration - **PostgreSQL-native workflows** that eliminate the complexity of external orchestration systems while enabling real-time, streaming applications.

**Key Innovation:**
- **Reduced infrastructure complexity** - Database-native workflows with standard Edge Function deployment
- **Real-time streaming** - Apps can stream workflow progress live to users with TypeScript clients  
- **AI-workflow ready** - Perfect for RAG systems, multi-step LLM processing, and deterministic AI agent workflows
- **Serverless-first** - Scales automatically with Supabase Edge Functions, minimal infrastructure management

**Modern Stack Integration:**
- Type-safe workflow definitions in TypeScript
- Seamless Supabase integration with Edge Functions
- Real-time subscriptions for live progress updates
- Production-ready with built-in retries and error handling

## Proven Track Record: From Crisis to Innovation

**AgencyMVP Turnaround (2016-2020)**

I joined AgencyMVP when they were 6 months past MVP deadline with critical performance issues blocking users. Over 4 years as lead developer, I:

- **Delivered production system in 6 months** working within existing architecture constraints
- **Scaled to thousands of users** with JavaScript, Ember.js, and PostgreSQL-first design
- **Led 5-person development team** through to $3.5M seed round (Silverton Partners)
- **Moved complex business logic into PostgreSQL** using database-native patterns and stored procedures

This experience significantly contributed to the PostgreSQL expertise and database-first thinking required to create pgflow.

## About me

- Creator of pgflow - PostgreSQL-native workflow orchestration
- Lead developer who helped a startup secure a $3.5M seed round
- 18+ years of full stack experience with deep PostgreSQL expertise
- Active Supabase community member - contribute tech solutions and help developers
- Specializes in PostgreSQL, Supabase, TypeScript, and database-first architecture
