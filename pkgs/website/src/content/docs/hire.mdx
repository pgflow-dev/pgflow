## What I can help with

- 🔄 Reliable background jobs and workflows (retries, timeouts, fanouts)
- 🔒 Secure schema and RLS policies that scale
- ⚡ Performance tuning and index design
- 🗄️ Postgres-first architecture for Supabase apps
- 👨‍🏫 Mentoring developers in database-first thinking

## How it works

<Steps>

1. Start with a 15-minute fit check call
2. Goal: confirm fit and define the next step
3. If useful, we schedule a deeper scoping session
