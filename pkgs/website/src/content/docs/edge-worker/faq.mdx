<Card title="Will running Edge Worker 24/7 affect my billing?" icon="information">
Short Answer: **Not really**

Edge Worker should not affect your Supabase billing in any significant way,
because Supabase charges for Edge Function invocations and data transfer,
and Edge Worker does not do lot of invocations and data transfer depends
on how many messages you process.

### Effect on Invocations

Edge Worker lives in a regular Edge Function and function must be called with
HTTP request to start it.

Worker will also do that HTTP request to respawn itself.
It does that when it detects that CPU or Clock soft limits were reached.

But even if your Worker would process hundreds of jobs per second for the whole
month without a stop and exceed limits every 6 seconds,
it will still not exceed the invocation limits of the Free Tier, which is set to 500.000 per month.

### Effect on Data Transfer

The bandwidth used by a worker depends mostly on how many and how big messages
it will get from the queue.

Just polling without returning any messages eats a tiny amount of bandwidth,
but shoul be negligible compared to retrieving actual data.

Currently, Supabase offers 5GB of bandwidth per month in the Free Tier.
