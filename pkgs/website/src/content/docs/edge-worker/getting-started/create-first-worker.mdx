We will create a simple **web scraping worker** that listens for URLs to scrape,
fetches the content, and logs the results.

Web scraping is a perfect use case for task queue workers,
because of built in retries and ability to fetch websites in parallel.

Setting it up is straightforward and takes just a few minutes.

<Aside type="caution" title="Requirements">
Before starting, please read the [Install Edge Worker](/edge-worker/getting-started/install-edge-worker/) guide.

<Steps>


1. ### Create your worker

    First, create a new Edge Function using the Supabase CLI. Then, replace its content with this code:

    ```typescript
    import { EdgeWorker } from "jsr:@pgflow/edge-worker";

    EdgeWorker.start(async (payload: { url: string }) => {
      const response = await fetch(payload.url);

      console.log("Scraped website!", {
        url: payload.url,
        status: response.status,
      });
    });
    ```

1. ### Start Edge Runtime

    Start the Edge Runtime with the following command:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx supabase functions serve
    ```

    This makes Supabase listen for incoming HTTP requests, but does not start
    your worker yet.

    :::note[Restarting Edge Runtime]
    You must stop and start the Edge Runtime every time you make changes
    to your workers because of the `per_worker` policy.
    :::

1. ### Start your worker

    Start the worker by sending an HTTP request to your new Edge Function
    (replace `<function-name>` with your function name):

    ```bash frame="none"
    curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>
    ```

    This will boot a new instance and start your worker:

		```bash frame="none"
    [Info] worker_id=<uuid> [WorkerLifecycle] Ensuring queue 'tasks' exists...
		```

4. ### Process your first message

    Your worker is now polling for messages on the `tasks` queue (which was automatically created during startup).

    Send a test message:

    ```sql frame="none"
    SELECT pgmq.send(
      queue_name => 'tasks',
      msg => '{"url": "https://example.com"}'::jsonb
    );
    ```

    The message will be processed immediately and you should see the following output:

    ```bash frame="none"
    [Info] worker_id=<uuid> [ExecutionController] Scheduling execution of task 1

    [Info] Scraped website! { url: "https://example.com", status: 200 }
    ```

    <Aside title="Queue Name">
      By default, your worker uses a queue named `tasks`. You can change this by setting the [`queueName` option](/edge-worker/getting-started/configuration/#queuename) - useful when running multiple workers or integrating with existing queues.
