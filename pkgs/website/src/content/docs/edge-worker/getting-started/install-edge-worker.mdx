Let's set up a few things before working with Edge Worker.
This setup needs to be done only once per project.

<NotProductionReady />

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Supabase CLI version **2.0.2** or higher (check with `supabase -v`)
- A local Supabase project set up
- Node.js and npm installed

If you haven't installed the CLI yet or need to upgrade, see Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).

<Steps>

1. ### Install Edge Worker

    You can install Edge Worker using the pgflow installer (recommended) or [manually](/how-to/manual-installation/) if you want more control over the process.
    
    Run the pgflow installer with npx:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx pgflow@latest install
    ```

    The installer will:
    - Detect your Supabase project automatically
    - Update your `config.toml` to enable connection pooling
    - Copy the required migrations to your migrations folder (including all Edge Worker tables)
    - Create a functions environment file if needed

    <Aside>
    If your Supabase directory isn't detected automatically, specify it manually:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx pgflow@latest install --supabase-path=./path/to/supabase
    ```
    </Aside>

    Then apply the migrations:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx supabase migrations up
    ```

    :::note
    The pgflow installer sets up both pgflow and Edge Worker schemas and tables, since pgflow builds on top of Edge Worker's functionality.
    :::

1. ### Restart Supabase

    To ensure all the configuration changes are applied, restart Supabase:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx supabase stop
    npx supabase start
    ```

</Steps>

### What was installed?

The pgflow installer set up everything needed for Edge Worker:

1. **Database schemas** - Required tables for worker management and message queuing
2. **Connection pooling** - Configured in transaction mode for proper worker operation
3. **Environment variables** - Database connection for Edge Functions
4. **Edge runtime policy** - Set to per_worker mode for background tasks

That's it! You're ready to create your first worker and start processing messages ðŸ¥³
