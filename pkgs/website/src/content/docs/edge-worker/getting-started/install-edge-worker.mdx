Let's set up a few things before working with Edge Worker.
This setup needs to be done only once per project.

<NotProductionReady />

<Aside type="caution" title="Prerequisites">
- Supabase CLI version **2.0.2** or higher (check with `supabase -v`)
- A local Supabase project set up

If you haven't installed the CLI yet or need to upgrade, see Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. ### Install migration

    Run this command to download the migration file to your project (replace `supabase/migrations` with your migrations folder):

    ```bash frame="none"
    wget -P supabase/migrations \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/refs/heads/main/pkgs/edge-worker/migrations/000_edge_worker_initial.sql
    ```

    Then apply the migration:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx supabase migration up
    ```

1. ### Prepare connection string

    Your worker needs to connect to your Supabase project's database.

    Edge Worker looks for the connection string in the `EDGE_WORKER_DB_URL` environment variable.

    For local development, put this in `supabase/functions/.env`:

    ```shell frame="none"
    EDGE_WORKER_DB_URL="postgresql://postgres.pooler-dev:postgres@pooler:6543/postgres"
    ```

1. ### Setup Connection Pool

    Modify the `db.pooler` section in your `supabase/config.toml` file
    to enable pooler and make sure that `db.pool_mode` is set to `"transaction"`.

    ```diff lang="toml" {8}
      [db.pooler]
    - enabled = false
    + enabled = true
      # Port to use for the local connection pooler.
      port = 54329
      # Specifies when a server connection can be reused by other clients.
      # Configure one of the supported pooler modes: `transaction`, `session`.
      pool_mode = "transaction"
      # How many server connections to allow per user/database pair.
      default_pool_size = 20
      # Maximum number of client connections allowed.
      max_client_conn = 100
    ```

		:::note[Transaction Mode]
		Edge Worker requires **transaction mode** connection because of Edge
		Function early termination. This will change in the future.
		:::

1. ### Setup Edge Runtime policy

    We need to change the Edge Runtime policy to `per_worker` to enable
    Background Tasks (see more in [Testing background tasks locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/background-tasks#testing-background-tasks-locally)).

   ```diff lang="toml"
     [edge_runtime]
     enabled = true
     # Configure one of the supported request policies: `oneshot`, `per_worker`.
     # Use `oneshot` for hot reload, or `per_worker` for load testing.
   - policy = "oneshot"
   + policy = "per_worker"
     # Port to attach the Chrome inspector for debugging edge functions.
     inspector_port = 8083
   ```

1. ### Restart Supabase

    To apply the changes, restart Supabase:

    ```bash frame="none"
    npx supabase stop
    npx supabase start
    ```

</Steps>

That's it! You're ready to create your first worker and start processing messages ðŸ¥³
