import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import activeWorkersSql from '../../../../../../edge-worker/sql/990_active_workers.sql?raw';
import inactiveWorkersSql from '../../../../../../edge-worker/sql/991_inactive_workers.sql?raw';

## Logging

Edge Worker logs various events to the console. You can change the log level
by setting `EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
// supabase/functions/.env
EDGE_WORKER_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Available log levels are:

- `debug`
- `info`
- `error`
- (more will come)

By default, Edge Worker's log level is `info`.

## Heartbeats

Edge Worker sends heartbeats every 5 seconds and updates `last_heartbeat_at` column in `edge_worker.workers` table.

### List of active workers

In order to get a list of active workers, we need to fetch those that have pinged in the last 6 seconds (+1s to account for delays):

```sql frame="none"
SELECT * 
FROM edge_worker.workers 
WHERE last_heartbeat_at > now() - make_interval(secs => 6)
```

### Helper SQL Views

Alterntively, use following SQL views to simplify those queries:

#### Active Workers

<Code code={activeWorkersSql} lang="sql" />

#### Inactive Workers

<Code code={inactiveWorkersSql} lang="sql" />
