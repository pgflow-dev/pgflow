This guide explains the current process for deploying and maintaining workers in hosted environment.

:::note
Running Edge Worker on Supabase.com currently requires a few additional setup steps. 
Thanks to ongoing collaboration with the Supabase team, these requirements will be simplified in future releases.

## Deploying workers

Workers are just regular Edge Functions that run for few minutes and auto-respawn
when CPU or Wall clock limits are reached (read more on those [Limits | Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/limits)).

Deploying new version is straightforward - you just update worker code
and call `npx supabase functions deploy worker-name` to deploy it.

When deploying a new version of your worker, be aware of the following:

Currently, deploying a new version **does not automatically terminate** the previous version.
This behavior will be improved in future releases.

## Starting Workers

Just like in local development, workers are started with a simple HTTP request.
However, you need to pass Authorization header with your ANON_KEY when calling function.
Consult this Supabase Docs page for details: [Invoking remote functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/deploy#invoking-remote-functions)

After the initial request, the worker will auto-respawn if terminated.

## Stopping Workers

Currently, there's no built-in way to gracefully stop a running worker.
You need to remove it from the Supabase Dashboard and wait for its CPU or clock limits to be reached
for it to stop.

**This will change in future releases.**

## Ensuring Worker Availability

To ensure your worker stays active, it's recommended to use Cron to ping
your worker edge function every few seconds. 
This is recommended in case there are any bugs in the respawn process,
which currently is triggered from withing the worker that is shutting down.

Use this Supabase guide [Invoking Supabase Function ever few seconds](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cron/quickstart#invoke-supabase-edge-function-every-30-seconds).
but use `5 seconds` instead of `30 seconds`.

:::note
Make sure to **set your own ANON key** in the `Authorization` header!
