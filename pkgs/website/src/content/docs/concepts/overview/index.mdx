pgflow is built on a few key concepts: **flows** are workflow definitions, **runs** are executions of those flows. Each flow has **steps** that can depend on other steps - a step waits for its dependencies to complete and gets access to their outputs.

Steps execute through **tasks** (the actual units of work) - regular steps have 1 task, but map steps create one task per array element for parallel processing.
