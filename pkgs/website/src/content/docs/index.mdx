## Why pgflow Exists

While Supabase provides the essential building blocks, pgflow brings enhanced orchestration for advanced workflow management.

### Have you run into any of these situations?

As apps grow, a little extra coordination can save a lot of engineering time. pgflow steps in right there:

<CardGrid>

  <Card title="Bringing the Pieces Together">
    Queues and Edge Functions shine on their own.
    pgflow wraps them in one orchestration interface, so you write features-not glue code.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Wanting a Bird’s-Eye View">
    When your workflows span several functions or use multiple cron schedules, it's handy to follow progress from a single place.
    pgflow's approach prioritizes at-a-glance visibility for runs, step states, retries and outputs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Extra Type Confidence">
    Define workflows in TypeScript and get a compile-time safety for the data flow between steps.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Keeping Everything Inside Supabase">
    All state, retries, and dependencies stay in the Postgres database you already trust-no extra services required.
  </Card>

</CardGrid>

### How pgflow Helps:

pgflow works in harmony with Supabase's tools, simplifying orchestration and enabling a more cohesive workflow.

Eliminate manual orchestration with Postgres‑native workflows, zero extra servers, and built‑in reliability

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Postgres-Native Orchestration" icon="approve-check">
    pgflow handles state transitions, dependencies, and execution control directly inside in your Supabase Postgres database. Everything is self-contained.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Durable Queue-Based Workers" icon="approve-check">
    Edge Functions pull tasks from a Postgres queue with automatic retries, back‑offs, and concurrency limits. 
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simple, Typed Flow Definitions" icon="approve-check">
    You specify flow logic once. pgflow enforces retries, timeouts, and step dependencies without custom plumbing.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Zero Extra Infra, Zero Lock-In" icon="approve-check">
    Everything stays in your Supabase project. No extra runtimes, no vendor dashboards.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### What You Can Build with pgflow:

- **AI Workflows:** Chain LLMs, scrape data, reason across tools, and recover from failures - all natively in Supabase.
- **Background Jobs:** Handle emails, file processing, and scheduled tasks with full visibility
- **Data Pipelines:** Extract, transform, and load data across systems without losing track of progress

## A complete workflow engine built on Postgres

pgflow is a workflow orchestration system with its core state management in your database, combining:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SQL Core" icon="star">
    Manage workflow state and transitions natively in Postgres with full ACID compliance
  </Card>
  <Card title="TypeScript DSL" icon="seti:typescript">
    Type-safe workflows with automatic inference and end-to-end compile-time safety.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edge Worker" icon="rocket">
    Auto-respawning, continuously running worker for low latency, reliable task execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI Tools" icon="seti:powershell">
    One-command setup: quickly deploy pgflow with automatic DB migrations.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Type-safe DAG workflows in TypeScript

Define parallel, type-safe DAG workflows effortlessly.

```typescript
new Flow<{ url: string }>({
  slug: 'analyze_website',
})
  .step(
    { slug: 'website' },
    async (input) => await scrapeWebsite(input.run.url)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'summary', dependsOn: ['website'] },
    async (input) => await summarizeWithAI(input.website.content)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'tags', dependsOn: ['website'] },
    async (input) => await extractTags(input.website.content)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'saveToDb', dependsOn: ['summary', 'tags'] },
    async ({ run, summary, tags }) =>
      await saveWebsite({
        user_id: run.user_id,
        website_url: run.url,
        summary,
        tags,
      })
  );
```

## End-to-end workflow orchestration

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Single source of truth" icon="open-book">
    All workflow definitions, state, and execution history stored in your Postgres database-simplifying monitoring and debugging.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reliable task processing" icon="rocket">
    Automatic retries, timeouts, at-least-once delivery and dead-letter handling built directly into your database.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Supabase-native" icon="puzzle">
    Deploy as Edge Functions with automatic restarts and zero-config integration with your existing Supabase project.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Developer experience" icon="approve-check">
    Full type inference between workflow steps with IDE autocompletion and compile-time safety for your entire workflow DAG.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## From workflow DSL to execution

Create and run workflows with a straightforward process:

1. **Define workflows using TypeScript DSL**
1. **Compile them to SQL migrations**
1. **Deploy as Supabase Edge Functions**
1. **Trigger workflows from your app or SQL**

The execution system handles the rest-scheduling steps when dependencies complete, retrying failed tasks, and aggregating results automatically.
