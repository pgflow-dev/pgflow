## A complete workflow engine built on Postgres

pgflow is a workflow orchestration system with its core state management in your database, combining:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SQL Core" icon="star">
    Manage workflow state and transitions natively in Postgres with full ACID compliance
  </Card>
  <Card title="TypeScript DSL" icon="seti:typescript">
    Type-safe workflows with automatic inference and end-to-end compile-time safety.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edge Worker" icon="rocket">
    Auto-respawning, continuously running worker for ultra-fast, reliable task execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI Tools" icon="seti:powershell">
    One-command setup: quickly deploy PGFlow with automatic DB migrations.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Type-safe DAG workflows in TypeScript

Define parallel, type-safe DAG workflows effortlessly.

```typescript
// Define a workflow with parallel steps
new Flow<{ url: string; user_id: string }>({
  slug: 'analyze_website',
  maxAttempts: 3,
  timeout: 4,
  baseDelay: 1,
})
  .step(
    { slug: 'website' },
    async (input) => await scrapeWebsite(input.run.url)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'summary', dependsOn: ['website'] },
    async (input) => await summarizeWithAI(input.website.content)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'tags', dependsOn: ['website'] },
    async (input) => await extractTags(input.website.content)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'saveToDb', dependsOn: ['summary', 'tags'] },
    async (input) =>
      await saveWebsite({
        user_id: input.run.user_id,
        website_url: input.run.url,
        summary: input.summary,
        tags: input.tags,
      })
  );
```

## End-to-end workflow orchestration

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Single source of truth" icon="open-book">
    All workflow definitions, state, and execution history stored in your Postgres database—simplifying monitoring and debugging.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reliable task processing" icon="rocket">
    Automatic retries, timeouts, at-least-once delivery and dead-letter handling built directly into your database.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Supabase-native" icon="puzzle">
    Deploy as Edge Functions with automatic restarts and zero-config integration with your existing Supabase project.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Developer experience" icon="approve-check">
    Full type inference between workflow steps with IDE autocompletion and compile-time safety for your entire workflow DAG.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## From workflow DSL to execution

Create and run workflows with a straightforward process:

1. **Define workflows using TypeScript DSL**
1. **Compile them to SQL migrations**
1. **Deploy as Supabase Edge Functions**
1. **Trigger workflows from your app or SQL**

The execution system handles the rest—scheduling steps when dependencies complete, retrying failed tasks, and aggregating results automatically.
