## Why pgflow

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="⚡ < 100ms job startup">
    Jobs start near-instantly with 100ms polling. No waiting minutes for cron jobs - your workflows begin executing immediately when triggered.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🔌 Run from anywhere">
    Trigger workflows from database triggers, scheduled pg_cron jobs, browser clients, or RPC calls. Ultimate flexibility in how you start your workflows.
  </Card>

  <Card title="📡 Realtime progress tracking">
    Watch your workflows execute in real-time via websocket updates. See each step complete as it happens, no polling required.
  </Card>

  <Card title="👁️ Full observability">
    Every step, retry, and failure is stored in SQL tables. Query your workflow history with standard PostgreSQL - complete transparency into execution.
  </Card>

  <Card title="✨ No boilerplate">
    Skip the tedious wiring of pg_cron to queues to Edge Functions. pgflow handles all the plumbing so you focus on business logic.
  </Card>

  <Card title="📦 Zero new infrastructure">
    Everything runs in your existing Supabase project. No external services, no vendor dashboards, no additional infrastructure to manage.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What Developers Are Saying

*Real comments after seeing early demos*

<TestimonialCarousel />

## Type-safe DAG workflows in TypeScript

Define parallel, type-safe DAG workflows effortlessly:

```typescript
new Flow<{ url: string }>({ slug: 'analyze_website' })
  .step(
    { slug: 'website' },
    async (input) => await scrapeWebsite(input.run.url)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'summary', dependsOn: ['website'] },
    async (input) => await summarizeWithAI(input.website.content)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'tags', dependsOn: ['website'] },
    async (input) => await extractTags(input.website.content)
  )
  .step(
    { slug: 'saveToDb', dependsOn: ['summary', 'tags'] },
    async ({ run, summary, tags }) =>
      await saveWebsite({
        user_id: run.user_id,
        website_url: run.url,
        summary,
        tags,
      })
  );
```

## Perfect for teams who

- Build AI applications on Supabase
- Need workflow orchestration without external services
- Want to debug exactly where workflows fail
- Value type safety and instant startup times
- Understand this is early but powerful software

## How it works

1. **Define** workflows in TypeScript with full type safety
2. **Compile** to SQL migrations with automatic dependencies
3. **Deploy** as Supabase Edge Functions
4. **Trigger** from SQL, browser, or scheduled jobs

Everything runs in your Postgres database - no external orchestrators, queues, or infrastructure.
