The **pgflow Client Library** enables real-time monitoring and observation of workflow execution in your applications. Built on Supabase's real-time infrastructure, it provides reactive updates as your flows progress through their lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Flow Monitoring** - Observe flow execution as it happens
- **Type-safe API** - Full TypeScript support with automatic type inference
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript
- **Broadcast Adapters** - Flexible real-time communication layer
- **Connection Management** - Automatic reconnection and error handling
