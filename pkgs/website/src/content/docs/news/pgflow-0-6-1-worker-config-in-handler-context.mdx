pgflow 0.6.1 adds `workerConfig` to the handler execution context, enabling intelligent decision-making based on worker configuration.

## Worker Configuration in Context

Handlers now have access to the complete worker configuration through `context.workerConfig` ([#200](https://github.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/issues/200)). This enables smarter handlers that can adapt their behavior based on retry limits, concurrency settings, timeouts, and other worker parameters.

```typescript
async function sendEmail(input, context) {
  const isLastAttempt = context.rawMessage.read_ct >= context.workerConfig.retry.limit;
  
  if (isLastAttempt) {
    // Use fallback email service on final attempt
    return await sendWithFallbackProvider(input.to, input.subject, input.body);
  }
  
  // Use primary email service for regular attempts
  return await sendWithPrimaryProvider(input.to, input.subject, input.body);
}
```

See the [context documentation](/reference/apis/context/#workerconfig) for complete details on available configuration properties and additional examples.


## Bug Fix

This release also fixes retry strategy validation to only enforce the 50-limit cap for exponential retry strategy, allowing higher limits for fixed strategy when needed ([#199](https://github.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/issues/199)).
