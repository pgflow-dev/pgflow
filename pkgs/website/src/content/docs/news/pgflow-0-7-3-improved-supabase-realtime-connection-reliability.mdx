pgflow 0.7.3 introduces a configurable `realtimeStabilizationDelayMs` option that addresses a known Supabase Realtime limitation where backend routing isn't fully established when the SUBSCRIBED event is emitted.

## What's New

The TypeScript client now includes a `realtimeStabilizationDelayMs` configuration option (default: 300ms) that adds a delay after subscribing to Realtime channels. This works around a [known Supabase Realtime issue](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/1599) where messages sent immediately after subscription confirmation may be missed because backend routing takes additional time to fully establish.

**When starting flows or retrieving runs**, the client waits for this stabilization period after receiving the SUBSCRIBED event, ensuring that all subsequent realtime events are properly received.

## Configuration

The default 300ms delay works reliably in most environments. If you experience missed events or connection issues, increase the delay to 400-500ms:

```typescript
import { PgflowClient } from '@pgflow/client';

// Increase stabilization delay for unreliable connections
const pgflow = new PgflowClient(supabase, {
  realtimeStabilizationDelayMs: 400,
});
```

You can also disable the delay by setting it to 0, though this may cause missed events in some environments:

```typescript
// Disable delay (may cause missed events)
const pgflow = new PgflowClient(supabase, {
  realtimeStabilizationDelayMs: 0,
});
```

See the [TypeScript Client documentation](/build/starting-flows/typescript-client/) and [PgflowClient API reference](/reference/pgflow-client/) for complete details.

## Upgrading
