pgflow 0.9.0 introduces the ControlPlane edge function, enabling HTTP-based flow compilation without requiring a local Deno installation.

## What Changed

The CLI no longer spawns Deno processes locally. Instead, compilation requests go through the ControlPlane edge function:

```
pgflow compile my_flow  -->  ControlPlane  -->  SQL migration
```

This simplifies the development setup and lays groundwork for future auto-compilation features where workers will verify and compile flows at startup without any CLI involvement.

<Aside type="note" title="Future Direction">
This release prepares for upcoming changes where edge workers will automatically verify flow shapes and trigger compilation when needed - making `pgflow compile` optional for development workflows.
</Aside>

## Upgrading

Update your packages following the [Update pgflow guide](/deploy/update-pgflow/), then run:

```bash frame="none"
npx pgflow@0.9.0 install
```

This creates the ControlPlane edge function at `supabase/functions/control-plane/`.

<Aside type="caution" title="Register Your Flows">
All existing flows must be added to the ControlPlane for compilation to work. See [Compilation](/concepts/compilation/) for details.
