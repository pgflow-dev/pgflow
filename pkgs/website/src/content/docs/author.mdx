## Hi, I'm Wojciech Majewski

Creator of pgflow with 18+ years architecting production systems. I'm building workflow orchestration that lives entirely in your Supabase database - no external orchestrators or infrastructure.

Currently working with teams to make their AI workflows observable, deterministic, and easy to reason about - all without leaving Supabase.

### Why pgflow

⚡ **\<100ms job startup** - Near-instant execution

🔌 **Run from anywhere** - SQL (triggers, pg_cron), browser, or RPC

📡 **Realtime progress tracking** - Live updates via websocket

👁️ **Full observability** - Complete history in SQL tables

✨ **No boilerplate** - Skip the cron/queues/Functions plumbing

📦 **Zero new infrastructure** - Everything in Supabase

## Let's explore

Evaluate if pgflow fits your LLM chains, RAG pipelines, or AI data processing. Get architectural guidance for production deployment.
</Card>

<Card title="Design Partnership" icon="puzzle">
Shape pgflow's roadmap for your use case. Early adopters get dedicated support and priority feature development.

<Card title="Proof of Concept" icon="approve-check-circle">
Build a working pgflow prototype for your specific use case. De-risk adoption with a real implementation.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## You're a perfect fit if you

- Already use Supabase for your application
- Have AI/LLM workloads that need orchestration
- Want everything in PostgreSQL (no external services)
- Need to see exactly where and why workflows fail
- Understand this is early but powerful software

## Availability

Working with a select few teams on pgflow integration. Limited bandwidth for new projects.

## Let's see if we're aligned

15-minute technical discussion. We'll quickly figure out if pgflow fits your needs.
