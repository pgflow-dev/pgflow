## Hi, I'm Wojciech Majewski

I love solving challenging problems with code - that's what drew me to workflow orchestration. pgflow keeps everything in Postgres: no external orchestrators, no extra infrastructure. Just workflows you can actually debug and reason about.

If you're working with AI/LLM pipelines in Supabase and want database reliability with TypeScript ergonomics, let's talk.

### Why pgflow

⚡ **\<100ms job startup** - Near-instant execution

🔌 **Run from anywhere** - SQL (triggers, pg_cron), browser, or RPC

📡 **Realtime progress tracking** - Live updates via websocket

👁️ **Full observability** - Complete history in SQL tables

✨ **No boilerplate** - Skip the cron/queues/Functions plumbing

📦 **Zero new infrastructure** - Everything in Supabase

## What I can help with

<CardGrid>
<Card title="pgflow for AI Workflows" icon="rocket">
Figure out if pgflow fits your LLM chains, RAG pipelines, or AI data processing. Get architectural guidance for deployment.
</Card>

<Card title="Supabase + AI Architecture" icon="seti:db">
Full-stack Supabase consulting for AI applications and database-first architectures.
</Card>

<Card title="Proof of Concept" icon="approve-check-circle">
Build a working pgflow prototype for your specific use case.
</Card>
</CardGrid>

## pgflow is a good fit if you

- Already use Supabase for your application
- Have AI/LLM workloads that need orchestration
- Want everything in PostgreSQL (no external services)
- Need to see exactly where and why workflows fail
- Understand this is early but powerful software

## Let's talk

15-minute technical discussion to see if pgflow fits your needs.
