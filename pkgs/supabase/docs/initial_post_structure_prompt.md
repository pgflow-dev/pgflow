# Initial Post Structure Prompt

I want to post about pgflow on r/Supabase in order to start reveal my project.
I will not release source code yet, but I want to explain what I am building,
why am I building it, hwo it works, what is the current status, how much work
is left before I can share it, and that I want to gather a closed group of
beta testers to gather focused high quality feedback (i can promise being
available and helping personally with integration - can hop on calls, review PRs, 
chat or talk, answer questions and figure out solutions, that's why i need 
a focused group of beta testers first).

suggest some kind of structure for the post (do not write the content yet)
