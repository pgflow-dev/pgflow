# pgflow Test Coverage

## Core Flow Tests

- ✅ Run Flow, tracking completion of steps
- ✅ Run Flow errors for missing dependencies
- ❌ Run Flow with circular dependencies
- ❌ Run Flow with missing step handlers
- ❌ Run Flow pause/resume functionality
- ❌ Run Flow cancel functionality

## Step State Tests

- ✅ Step status transitions (pending -> completed/failed)
- ✅ Step dependency validation
- ✅ Step result storage
- ❌ Step timeout handling
- ❌ Step concurrency handling
- ❌ Step idempotency

## Error Handling Tests

- ✅ Failed step retry behavior
- ✅ Maximum retries exceeded
- ✅ Invalid flow configuration
- ❌ Database constraint violations
- ❌ Out of order execution attempts
- ❌ Race condition handling

## Edge Cases

- ❌ Very large payloads
- ❌ Many concurrent flows
- ❌ Network partitions
- ❌ Database deadlocks
- ❌ Long running steps
- ❌ Steps with high failure rates

## Performance Tests

- ❌ Load testing maximum concurrent flows
- ❌ Load testing step execution throughput
- ❌ Database index optimization verification
- ❌ Memory usage under load
- ❌ Connection pool exhaustion
