-- PRE-MIGRATION CHECK for 20251006073122_pgflow_add_map_step_type.sql
-- ================================================================================
-- Purpose: Identify data that requires migration before schema changes
-- When to run: BEFORE applying the migration
-- What to do with output:
--   - ‚úÖ Only INFO rows? You're good to migrate
--   - ‚ö†Ô∏è  DATA_* rows? Expected - migration handles these automatically
--   - üÜò Unexpected rows? Copy/paste output for help

-- ================================================================================
-- type                       | identifier              | details
-- ---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------
-- DATA_CLEANUP_CREATED       | run=abc12345 step=foo   | Cleanup needed
-- DATA_BACKFILL_STARTED      | run=def67890 step=bar   | Backfill needed
-- DATA_BACKFILL_COMPLETED    | Found 100 completed...  | Backfill needed
-- INFO_SUMMARY               | total_step_states=114   | Overall stats
--
-- ‚úÖ Safe to migrate - these data issues are handled automatically by the migration
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: This migration MUST use the correct version that splits ALTER TABLE
--     statements. The packaged version combines them and will FAIL on started steps.
