## Before Contributing Code

pgflow has ongoing development and planned features. To avoid duplicate or conflicting work:

1. **Join [Discord](https://pgflow.dev/discord/)** - Discuss your idea first
2. **Open an issue** - Get feedback before investing time
3. **Start a discussion** - For bigger ideas or questions
