# When and How to Use Nx MCP Server

Nx MCP Server should be used whenever an LLM (Large Language Model) needs to reason about the structure, configuration, and relationships within an Nx monorepo workspace. It gives the model a comprehensive, high-level view of the workspace, letting it understand project dependencies, architecture, CI status, and code generation capabilities—information that is not apparent from individual files alone. This is especially helpful for tasks like analyzing project structure, suggesting where to add new features, understanding the effect of changes, resolving CI failures, or ensuring code actions follow local best practices.

Use Nx MCP Server when you want your AI assistant to go beyond basic code editing and become aware of the entire monorepo context—such as answering architecture questions, generating and connecting new code using Nx generators, analyzing the impact of changes across projects, or providing precise configuration guidance based on the current workspace state. Whenever detailed, workspace-wide knowledge or integration with Nx features is needed for accurate and context-aware code assistance, leveraging the Nx MCP Server is strongly recommended.
