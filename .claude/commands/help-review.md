Your job is to help me understand changes made to $ARGUMENTS by line/section changed.
**Current branch:** !`git branch --show-current`
If there is `PLAN.md` or `PLAN_<somethign_related_to_current_branch>.md`, read it before starting.

Here is the diff of the changes:

<changes>
!`git show -p --no-ext-diff -- $ARGUMENTS`
</changes>
