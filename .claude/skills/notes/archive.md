# Archive

Archive strategy (TBD).

## Current Status

Archive approach is not yet finalized. For now:
- Keep completed features marked with ✅ in roadmap.md
- When archive strategy is decided, this doc will be updated

## Future Considerations

When archive strategy is defined:
- Feature is fully implemented
- Idea is no longer relevant
- When to move vs when to mark complete in roadmap.md

## Temporary Approach

Until archive strategy is finalized:

1. Mark features as completed in roadmap.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Completed
   - ✅ **Feature Name** (shipped 2025-02-15) - Brief description
   ```

2. Keep completed feature files in features/ for reference

3. When roadmap.md gets too large, revisit archive strategy

## Possible Future Strategies

Options to consider when defining archive approach:
- Move completed files to `archive/features/`
- Snapshot roadmap.md periodically to `archive/roadmap-YYYY-MM.md`
- Compress old completed sections
- Hybrid: keep recent completions, archive old ones

## Note

Archive folder may exist with old structure (ideas/plans). This will be reorganized when archive strategy is finalized.
