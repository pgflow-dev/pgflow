# Patterns

## Red Flags (Paranoia)
- **Analysis Paralysis**: >2h research, multiple rewrites, >5 blockers
- **Impostor Syndrome**: Fear of exposure, zero complaints but worried
- **Momentum Paranoia**: "One bug kills project", no actual negative feedback
- **Complexity Theater**: Over-engineering to appear professional
- **Scope Creep**: "While I'm at it" additions

## Green Flags (Justified)
- **Real Stakes**: Paying customers, data loss risk, financial transactions
- **Active Users**: Users asked for it, complaints about delays
- **pgflow Critical Path**: Install/compile/onboarding must work

## Quick Detection
- No paying customers + high fear = Paranoia
- <50 users + scale worries = Premature optimization
- Zero complaints + embarrassment = Impostor syndrome
- Rewriting without shipping = Perfectionism
