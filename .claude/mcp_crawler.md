## MCP Tools for Web Reading/Crawling

For reading and crawling web content, Claude Code has access to an MCP server that provides enhanced web capabilities:

- **MCP Server**: crawl4ai-sse at http://localhost:11235/mcp/sse
- **Usage**: When you need to read web content or crawl websites, use the MCP tools instead of the standard WebFetch
- **Benefits**: The MCP tools provide more robust capabilities for web content extraction and processing
