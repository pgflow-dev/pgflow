your job is to read the beads related to the pgf-3hs epic about conditionals, verify current implementation in possibilities in @pkgs/dsl/__tests__/types/condition-pattern.test-d.ts @pkgs/dsl/__tests__/types/skippable-deps.test-d.ts and also some parts of schema @pkgs/core/schemas/0100_function__cascade_force_skip_steps.sql  @pkgs/core/schemas/0100_function_complete_task.sql and the tests for the @pkgs/dsl/__tests__/runtime/condition-options.test.ts  and @pkgs/core/schemas/0100_function_cascade_resolve_conditions.sql and the @pkgs/core/supabase/tests/condition_evaluation/ and @pkgs/core/supabase/tests/_cascade_force_skip_steps/ and the @.changeset/add-when-failed-option.md @.changeset/skip-infrastructure-schema.md and @pkgs/dsl/__tests__/runtime/when-failed-options.test.ts @pkgs/core/supabase/tests/fail_task_when_failed/ and anything you think is related, then you should read the current docs, especially the onboarding in @pkgs/website/src/content/docs/get-started/ , the @pkgs/website/src/content/docs/concepts/, and @pkgs/website/src/content/docs/build/  and you should come up with a plan on how it would be best to explain the conditions, skipping, skip cascades, whenFailed, json containment matching and all that in a way that is easy to understand, visual and have examples. i think we would need a DAG d2 diagrams showing step by step what happens for each skip/fail mode, showing the differences of what happens whe stuff is skipped/failed and what happes to dependents/run based on what whenUnmet/retriesExhausted modes selected. probably need a new color for skipped status in @pkgs/website/src/assets/pgflow-theme.d2 and new explanation in the @.claude/skills/writing-d2-diagrams/SKILL.md and some updates into @.claude/skills/writing-pgflow-flows/SKILL.md  . you should leverage the parallel task agents for as much work as possible in order to answer as many questions that you have created. you should do the research in multiple stages. first, think about what you should understand first, so then you can spawn multiple task agents that will read and summarize and explain stuff to you. then you will be able to plan additional stages of tasks for the parallel subagents. the results of your work should be a comphrehensive plan
