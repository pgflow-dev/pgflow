i am working on an app for storing and searching/chatting with(via LLMs/GPT)
all my online activity gathered from various sources

my sources i plan to implement are:

- received and sent emails
- received and sent messenger messages (signal, whatsapp, discord etc)
- my kindle highlights
- new firefox bookmarks
- new omnivore/pocket bookmarks
- my new notes from logseq and notion
- comments on my pull requests
- my git commits from github and gitlab
- my weight readings from a bluetooth scale
- my workouts logged via health apps
- my consumed food and caloric intake logged from fitatu or other app
- my healh metrics like pulse, blood pressure
- my sleep data from sleep-as-android

the app is in early stages and is very experimental - i constantly fiddle with
various ideas and want to interpret data in various ways:

- displaying an unified and filterable journal-type of page containing all of my activity in one place
- create embeddings for all the data (A MUST!) so they can be used for retrieval augmented generation pipeline
- forward some of the data to remote webhooks
- create derived tables to store only subset of raws based on source_type and other filters, probably with more structured column etc
- trigger workflows in my automation system based on new rows of specific type
- full-text searching the whole collection
