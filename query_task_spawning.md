I need to implement a way to spawn multiple tasks per step. Based on a single dependency, those kind of steps would be constrained to have only one dependency. And this dependency must have an array output. This kind of step or type of step should just take the dependency and for each array item in the dependency output it should spawn a new task and map those tasks with original items by using task index. So after all tasks are completed, we can combine them back into an array of results based on the order encoded in task index. So I'm wondering, should this kind of task spawning logic be encoded deliberately and explicitly as a way to process arrays or there should be something more generic to support other ways of spawning tasks? I don't really have any idea for other ways of spawning tasks and to think about tasks that will run conditions or tasks that will run preprocessing of the inputs, we already have it covered in another way by introducing those steps via the DSL compiler injection. So I'm wondering if there is really any need to change the way the tasks are spawned for a step other than a single task per step versus multiple tasks per step for the parallel array processing.
