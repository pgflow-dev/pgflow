### Where complex becomes clockwork.

> "Things just happen. What the hell. And the reason things just happen is that a hundred billion other things just happened, all working unheeded and unseen, to make sure that they do."

## Overview

pgflow is a workflow orchestration system that runs directly in your Postgres database - ideal for building reliable AI workflows, background jobs, and data pipelines on Supabase without external services.

The system combines:

- **[SQL Core](./pkgs/core/)** - Workflow state management natively in Postgres with ACID compliance
- **[TypeScript DSL](./pkgs/dsl/)** - Type-safe workflow definitions with automatic inference
- **[Edge Worker](./pkgs/edge-worker/)** - Auto-respawning task processor that handles retries and concurrency
- **[CLI Tools](./pkgs/cli/)** - One-command setup with automatic schema migrations

## Documentation

The pgflow documentation is [available on pgflow.dev](https://pgflow.dev).

## Why pgflow?

When you need more than just isolated background jobs, but don't want the complexity of external orchestration systems:

- **Postgres as the Single Source of Truth** - All definitions, state, and history in your database
- **Zero Infrastructure** - No external services, dashboards, or control planes
- **Type-Safe Workflows** - Full compile-time safety between workflow steps
- **Reliable Background Jobs** - Automatic retries with backoff and observability

## What can you build?

- **AI Workflows** - Chain LLMs, scrape data, reason across tools, and handle failures
- **Background Jobs** - Process emails, files, and scheduled tasks with full visibility
- **Data Pipelines** - Extract, transform, and load data with built-in dependency handling

## How pgflow works

1. **Define workflows using TypeScript DSL**
2. **Compile them to SQL migrations**
3. **Deploy as Supabase Edge Functions**
4. **Trigger workflows from your app or SQL**

The execution system handles the rest - scheduling steps when dependencies complete, retrying failed tasks, and aggregating results automatically.
