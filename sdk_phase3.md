# SDK Phase 3: Client-Side State Management

Phase 3 builds upon the real-time communication layer from Phase 2 to implement client-side state management through the FlowRun and FlowStep classes. This phase focuses on creating a robust, type-safe representation of flow state that updates in real-time.

## Objectives

1. Implement the FlowRun class for flow-level state management
2. Create the FlowStep class for step-level state management
3. Implement event-driven state updates and event propagation
4. Add state synchronization mechanisms

## FlowRun Implementation

1. **State Management:**
   - Create private state container with public getters
   - Implement state update methods with proper validation
   - Add status precedence mechanism to handle out-of-order events

2. **Event System:**
   - Integrate NanoEvents for event emission
   - Create type-safe event subscription methods
   - Implement event propagation from adapter to client state

3. **Step Management:**
   - Create step instance caching and retrieval
   - Implement step creation and initialization
   - Add step event routing and delegation

4. **Status Waiting:**
   - Implement promise-based waitForStatus method
   - Add timeout and cancellation support
   - Create error handling for status waiting

## FlowStep Implementation

1. **Step State Management:**
   - Create private state container with public getters
   - Implement state update methods with validation
   - Add step-specific status logic

2. **Event System:**
   - Implement type-safe step event subscription
   - Create step-specific event handling
   - Add parent flow communication

3. **Status Waiting:**
   - Implement step-specific waitForStatus method
   - Add timeout and cancellation support
   - Create error handling for step status waiting

## State Synchronization

1. **Initial State:**
   - Create initialization from complete state snapshot
   - Convert array of step_states to Map<step_slug, state> for efficient lookup
   - Implement type conversion and validation
   - Add state initialization error handling

2. **Event-Based Updates:**
   - Implement real-time state updates from events
   - Create validation for event-based state changes
   - Add safeguards for race conditions and out-of-order events

## Deliverables

1. Complete FlowRun and FlowStep class implementations
2. Robust event-driven state management system
3. Type-safe event subscription mechanisms
4. Status waiting functionality with timeout/cancellation support

This phase provides the core client-side state management functionality, setting the stage for the main Client class implementation in Phase 4.
