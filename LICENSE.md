# pgflow License - Business Source License 1.1

> ‚úÖ **You can freely build and host your apps on Supabase using pgflow**  
> ‚úÖ **You can fork, modify, and contribute to pgflow in the spirit of open source**  
> ‚ùå Offering pgflow as a managed/hosted service requires a separate agreement **<u>for now</u>** 

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in pgflow! üôè

pgflow was built to serve the PostgreSQL community‚Äîwith a special focus on Supabase users. It empowers you to build and host your applications on Supabase completely free of charge. While you can freely use pgflow for your own applications, offering it as a managed or hosted service requires a separate agreement as I work to determine the best long-term approach for sustainability.

## Why BSL?

I have chosen the Business Source License (BSL) for the following reasons:

- üöÄ **Focused Development:**  
  With no external funding, my priority is to build a robust tool. The BSL allows me to concentrate on development without rushing into long-term licensing decisions.

- üîç **Exploring Options:**  
  The BSL gives me the flexibility to explore various long-term strategies for pgflow while ensuring it remains free for individual and company use on Supabase.

- ‚è≥ **Adaptability for the Future:**  
  This licensing model is a temporary measure, allowing for evaluation and refinement based on community feedback and potential partnerships. The approach may evolve as pgflow grows.

## Licensing for Different Parts of pgflow

> [!WARNING]
> Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all components of pgflow are licensed under the Business Source License (BSL). The `LICENSE` file in each respective package is the source of truth and should be consulted for definitive licensing information.

pgflow consists of multiple packages, each with its own license:

- **`pkgs/edge-worker/`** ‚Äì Licensed under **Apache 2.0**, so you can freely use and modify it with no additional restrictions.
- **`pkgs/website/`** ‚Äì Licensed under **Apache 2.0**, same as the edge-worker package, allowing free use, modification, and distribution of the documentation website.
