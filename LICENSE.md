# pgflow License - Elastic License 2.0

> ✅ **You can freely build and host your apps on Supabase using pgflow**  
> ✅ **You can fork, modify, and contribute to pgflow in the spirit of open source**  
> ❌ Offering pgflow as a managed/hosted service requires a separate agreement

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in pgflow! 🙏

pgflow was built to serve the PostgreSQL community—with a special focus on Supabase users. It empowers you to build and host your applications on Supabase completely free of charge. While you can freely use pgflow for your own applications, offering it as a managed or hosted service requires a separate agreement as I work to determine the best long-term approach for sustainability.

## Why Elastic License 2.0?

I have chosen the Elastic License 2.0 for the following reasons:

- 🚀 **Focused Development:**  
  With no external funding, my priority is to build a robust tool. The Elastic License 2.0 allows me to concentrate on development without rushing into long-term licensing decisions.

- 🔍 **Exploring Options:**  
  The Elastic License 2.0 gives me the flexibility to explore various long-term strategies for pgflow while ensuring it remains free for individual and company use on Supabase.

- ⏳ **Adaptability for the Future:**  
  This licensing model is a temporary measure, allowing for evaluation and refinement based on community feedback and potential partnerships. The approach may evolve as pgflow grows.

## Licensing for Different Parts of pgflow

> [!WARNING]
> Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all components of pgflow are licensed under the Elastic License 2.0. The `LICENSE` file in each respective package is the source of truth and should be consulted for definitive licensing information.

pgflow consists of multiple packages, each with its own license:

- **`pkgs/core/`** – Licensed under **Elastic License 2.0**, with the goal of revisiting the licensing model in the future.  
- **`pkgs/edge-worker/`** – Licensed under **Apache 2.0**, so you can freely use and modify it with no additional restrictions.
- **`pkgs/website/`** – Licensed under **Apache 2.0**, same as the edge-worker package, allowing free use, modification, and distribution of the documentation website.

## "The 'Please Don't Sue Me' Section"

## Final Thoughts

I appreciate the support and understanding of the community as I work through these early decisions. Your feedback helps pgflow evolve into a tool that better serves everyone's needs.

Thank you for your support! 💚
