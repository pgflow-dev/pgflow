# pgflow Ideas and Future Enhancements

## Queue Management Tooling

### Queue Discovery and Validation CLI Commands

**Problem**: As pgflow deployments scale with multiple flows and queue routing, users need tooling to understand and manage their queue topology.

**Proposed CLI Commands:**

```bash
# List all queues in database
pgflow queues list
# Output:
# Queue Name                   | Type      | Messages | Flows Using
# ---------------------------- |-----------|----------|-------------
# user_onboarding_processor    | pgflow    | 23       | user_onboarding
# email_notification_sender    | pgflow    | 5        | user_onboarding, order_flow  
# order_processing_pipeline    | pgflow    | 0        | order_flow
# analytics_data_processor     | pgflow    | 156      | analytics_flow
# manual_approval_queue        | manual    | 0        | approval_flow (queue=false)

# List queues used by specific flow
pgflow queues list --flow user_onboarding
# Output:
# Queue Name                   | Steps Using           | Status
# ---------------------------- |----------------------|--------
# user_onboarding_processor    | fetch_user, setup    | active
# email_notification_sender    | send_welcome         | active

# Validate queue names and check for potential conflicts
pgflow queues validate
# Output:
# ✅ No naming conflicts detected
# ⚠️  Queue "data" is generic - consider more specific name
# ⚠️  Queue "processor" conflicts with external system
# ✅ All queue names follow best practices

# Check for unused queues (cleanup candidates)
pgflow queues cleanup --dry-run
# Output:
# Unused queues found:
# - old_email_processor (last used: 30 days ago)
# - temp_migration_queue (last used: 90 days ago)
# Run 'pgflow queues cleanup' to remove them

# Show queue topology/dependencies
pgflow queues graph --flow user_onboarding
# Output: ASCII or mermaid diagram showing flow -> queues -> workers
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Query `pgflow.flows`, `pgflow.steps`, and `pgmq` tables
- Cross-reference with active workers if possible
- Provide JSON output option for programmatic usage
- Integration with monitoring/alerting systems

**Benefits:**
- Helps users understand their queue topology
- Identifies potential naming conflicts early
- Assists with capacity planning and monitoring
- Simplifies queue cleanup and maintenance

**Priority**: Post-MVP enhancement (after Phase 4)

**Related Features:**
- Queue naming best practices documentation
- Queue validation warnings in DSL
- Integration with monitoring dashboards
