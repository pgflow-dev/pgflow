  - Added validation for non-array and NULL outputs to map steps
  - Comprehensive tests for NULL behavior and error cases

- [x] **PR #216: Array Element Distribution** (CRITICAL - BLOCKS REAL MAP USAGE)

  - Enhanced start_tasks() to distribute array elements to map tasks
  - Each map task receives its specific array element based on task_index

  - Tests with actual array data processing

- [x] **PR #217: Output Aggregation** - `09-17-add-map-step-output-aggregation` (THIS PR)

  - Inline aggregation implementation in complete_task, start_tasks, maybe_complete_run
  - Full test coverage (17 tests) for all aggregation scenarios
  - Handles NULL preservation, empty arrays, order preservation
  - Validates non-array outputs to map steps fail correctly
  - Fixed broadcast aggregation to send full array not individual task output

- [x] **PR #218: DSL Support for .map() Step Type** - `09-18-add-map-support-to-dsl` ‚úÖ COMPLETED

  - Added `.map()` method to Flow DSL for defining map steps
  - Constraints:
    - Locked to exactly one dependency (enforced at compile time)
    - Dependency must return an array (type-checked)
  - Syntax design:
    - Dependent maps: `flow.map({ slug: 'stepName', array: 'arrayReturningStep' }, handler)`
    - Root maps: Omit array property
  - Return type always inferred as array
  - Comprehensive tests:
    - Runtime validation of array dependencies
    - Type safety for input/output types
    - Compile-time enforcement of single dependency rule
  - Fixed complex TypeScript type inference issue with overloads
  - Added compile-time duplicate slug detection across all DSL methods
  - Fixed all linting errors (replaced `{}` with `Record<string, never>`)
  - Updated DSL README with .map() documentation
  - Created detailed changeset

#### ‚ùå Remaining Work (Priority Order)

- [ ] **Priority 1: Fix Orphaned Messages on Run Failure** üö® CRITICAL

  - Archive all pending messages when run fails
  - Handle map sibling tasks specially
  - Fix type constraint violations to fail immediately without retries
  - See detailed plan: [PLAN_orphaned_messages.md](./PLAN_orphaned_messages.md)
  - **Critical for production: prevents queue performance degradation**
  - Tests already written (stashed) that document the problem

- [ ] **Priority 2: Performance Optimization - step_states.output Column**

  - Migrate from inline aggregation to storing outputs in step_states
  - See detailed plan: [PLAN_step_output.md](./PLAN_step_output.md)
  - Benefits:
    - Eliminate redundant aggregation queries
    - 30-70% performance improvement for map chains
    - Cleaner architecture with single source of truth
  - Implementation:
    - Add output column to step_states table
    - Update complete_task to populate output on completion
    - Simplify consumers (start_tasks, maybe_complete_run, broadcasts)
    - Update all aggregation tests (~17 files)
  - **Note**: This is an optimization that should be done after core functionality is stable

- [ ] **Priority 3: Integration Tests**

  - End-to-end workflows with real array data
  - Basic happy path coverage
  - This should be minimal and added to the Edge Worker integration test suite for now

- [ ] **Priority 4: Update core README**

  - `pkgs/core/README.md`

    - Add new section describing the step types
    - Describe single step briefly, focus on describing map step type and how it differs
    - Make sure to mention that maps are constrained to have exactly one dependency
    - Show multiple cases of inputs -> task creation
    - Explain edge cases (empty array propagation, invalid array input)
    - Explain root map vs dependent map and how it gets handled and what restrictions those apply on the Flow input
    - Explain cascade completion of taskless steps and its limitations

- [ ] **Priority 5: Add docs page**

  - **Add basic docs page**

    - put it into `pkgs/website/src/content/docs/concepts/array-and-map-steps.mdx`
    - describe the DSL and how the map works and why we need it
    - show example usage of root map
    - show example usage of dependent map
    - focus mostly on how to use it, instead of how it works under the hood
    - link to the README's for more details

- [ ] **Priority 6: Migration Consolidation** (Do this last before merge!)

  - Remove all temporary/incremental migrations from feature branches
  - Generate a single consolidated migration for the entire map infrastructure
  - Ensure clean migration path from current production schema
  - If NULL improvement is done, include it in the consolidated migration

- [ ] **Priority 7: Graphite Stack Merge**

  - Configure Graphite merge queue for the complete PR stack
  - Ensure all PRs in sequence can be merged together
  - Final validation before merge to main
  - Merge queue to be set such that it verifies only the top PR
    (it is because of CI check for temp migrations)
