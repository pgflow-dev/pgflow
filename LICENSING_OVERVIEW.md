# pgflow License - AGPLv3

> ‚úÖ **You can freely build and host your apps on Supabase using pgflow**

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in pgflow! üôè

pgflow was built to serve the PostgreSQL community‚Äîwith a special focus on Supabase users. **Please note that pgflow is not affiliated with nor endorsed (yet!) by Supabase.** It empowers you to build and host your applications on Supabase entirely free of charge. While you can freely use pgflow for your own projects, offering it as a managed or hosted service requires strict adherence to AGPLv3 or obtaining a separate commercial agreement ([contact me for details](mailto:owner@pgflow.dev)). I am still exploring the best long-term approach for sustainability.

## Why AGPLv3?

I have chosen the **GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.0** for the following reasons:

- üöÄ **Focused Development:**
  With no external funding, my priority is building a robust tool. The AGPLv3 enables me to concentrate on development without rushing into long-term licensing decisions.

- üîç **Exploring Options:**
  The AGPLv3 provides flexibility to consider different long-term strategies for pgflow, while ensuring it remains free for both personal and commercial use on Supabase.

- ‚è≥ **Adaptability for the Future:**
  This licensing model is a temporary measure, allowing for evaluation and refinement based on community feedback and potential partnerships. The approach may evolve as pgflow grows.

Thank you for your support! üíö
