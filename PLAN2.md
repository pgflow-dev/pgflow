# Navigation Fix - Implementation Plan

Based on tech writer feedback (answers.md) adapted to our current structure.

## Core Approach: Option 2.5

**Default to Flows** with persistent secondary path to Background Jobs. No forced overview, minimal upfront decisions.

## Changes to Implement

### 1. Landing Page CTAs (Keep Current)

‚úÖ **No change needed** - current CTAs are correct:
```yaml
Primary: "Get Started" ‚Üí /get-started/installation/
Secondary: "How It Works" ‚Üí /concepts/overview/how-pgflow-works/
```

**Rationale:** Installation is required for both paths, so it's the right first step.

### 2. Sidebar Structure (Keep Current with Minor Tweak)

‚úÖ **Keep current nested structure** - it's correct:
```
Get Started (link: /get-started/installation/)
  - Installation
  - FAQ
  - Flows/
    - Create Flow
    - Compile Flow
    - Run Flow
  - Background Jobs/
    - Create Worker
```

**Why this works:**
- "Flows/" contains the sequential tutorial (create ‚Üí compile ‚Üí run)
- "Background Jobs/" is separate alternative path
- Nested structure shows they're both multi-step processes
- Visual hierarchy through ordering (Flows first)

**Rationale:** Tech writer suggested flat structure doesn't account for our multi-step tutorials. Our nested structure is better.

### 3. Remove Get Started Overview Page

‚ùå **Delete `/get-started/index.mdx`**

**Current content:**
- "Choose your path" cards (flows vs bg jobs)
- Links to installation
- Redundant with new decision strip

**Why remove:**
- Adds friction before installation
- Decision should come AFTER installation
- Forces reading when users want to act
- Installation is the actual first step

**Sidebar impact:**
- Get Started topic links directly to Installation
- Remove "Overview" from sidebar items
- Installation becomes the landing page

### 4. Add Decision Strip to Installation Page

‚úÖ **Add at end of `/get-started/installation.mdx`:**

```markdown
## Next Steps

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="‚Üí Create Your First Flow" icon="rocket">
    **Recommended:** Build multi-step workflows with dependencies, retries, and full observability.

    Perfect for: AI pipelines, data processing, complex orchestration

    [Start building ‚Üí](/get-started/flows/create-flow/)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Or: Run Background Jobs" icon="setting">
    **Simpler alternative:** Just need background task processing with retries?

    Perfect for: Async tasks, webhooks, one-off jobs

    [Create a worker ‚Üí](/get-started/background-jobs/create-worker/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip">
Most users want workflows. Choose background jobs only if you need simple queue processing without orchestration.
</Aside>
```

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Flows card: Larger, "Recommended" badge, primary styling
- BG Jobs card: Smaller, "Or:" prefix, secondary styling
- Clear nudge toward flows without hiding jobs

### 5. Optional: Compare Page (Future)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not implementing now** - would be useful later:

Potential page: `/get-started/flows-vs-background-jobs/` or `/concepts/flows-vs-background-jobs/`

**Content (future):**
- Side-by-side comparison table
- When to use each
- Technical differences
- Link from FAQ or concepts

**Why not now:**
- Can be added later if users request it
- Not blocking for launch
- Decision strip is sufficient

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove Get Started Overview
```bash
git rm pkgs/website/src/content/docs/get-started/index.mdx
```

### Step 2: Update Sidebar Config
Remove "Overview" item from Get Started sidebar:
```javascript
{
  label: 'Get Started',
  icon: 'rocket',
  link: '/get-started/installation/',
  id: 'get-started',
  items: [
    // Remove: { label: 'Overview', link: '/get-started/' },
    { label: 'Installation', link: '/get-started/installation/' },
    { label: 'FAQ', link: '/get-started/faq/' },
    {
      label: 'Flows',
      autogenerate: { directory: 'get-started/flows/' },
    },
    {
      label: 'Background Jobs',
      autogenerate: { directory: 'get-started/background-jobs/' },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Step 3: Add Decision Strip to Installation
At end of `/get-started/installation.mdx`, add the "Next Steps" section with two cards (see above).

### Step 4: Add Redirect
Since we're removing `/get-started/` index, add redirect:
```javascript
redirects: {
  '/get-started/': '/get-started/installation/',
}
```

## User Journey After Changes

### Flow User (90% case):
```
1. Land on homepage ‚Üí "Get Started"
2. Install pgflow
3. See decision strip ‚Üí Choose "Create Your First Flow" (emphasized)
4. Follow tutorial: create ‚Üí compile ‚Üí run
```

### BG Jobs User (10% case):
```
1. Land on homepage ‚Üí "Get Started"
2. Install pgflow
3. See decision strip ‚Üí Choose "Run Background Jobs" (visible alternative)
4. Create worker, done
```

**Key improvement:** Both paths go through installation first, then make informed choice with clear nudge toward flows.

## Rationale

**Why this works:**
1. ‚úÖ Minimal upfront decisions (just "Get Started")
2. ‚úÖ Installation is required step (shown first)
3. ‚úÖ Choice comes AFTER installation (when relevant)
4. ‚úÖ Clear visual hierarchy (Flows emphasized)
5. ‚úÖ BG Jobs still discoverable (not hidden)
6. ‚úÖ Respects scanning behavior (big buttons, not text)
7. ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure (complexity after install)

**Aligns with tech writer advice:**
- Default to flows ‚úÖ
- Persistent secondary path ‚úÖ
- Post-install choice strip ‚úÖ
- No forced overview ‚úÖ
- Visual hierarchy ‚úÖ
